series_2023_002,,,,Alternative Visions,,,"We open our annual showcase of historical and current experimental film with Luis Buñuel’s Surrealist classics, L’age d’or and Un chien Andalou. Further historical explorations include a guest-curated program of local ninety-year-old filmmaker Paul Fillinger’s one-of-a-kind educational films, which he refers to as experiential cinema. Leeroy K. Y. Kang presents a selection of queer Asian experimental video, from Bruce and Norman Yonemoto to Patty Chang. There are a number of opportunities to see and hear guest artists: Ernie Gehr travels from New York with four recent city films, Peggy Ahwesh and Jacqueline Goss screen their “theoretical musical about scientist and social thinker Wilhelm Reich,” Canadian Lindsay McIntyre discusses a selection of her films exploring her Inuit and settler ancestry, and local filmmaker Jerome Hiler presents four programs of his work. The series includes two programs of recent films drawing on varied sources, including Super 8mm, glass slides and negatives, photographs, audio recordings, ray-o-grams, and artificial intelligence, with guest artists in person. We also pay tribute to longtime cocurator of Alternative Visions Jeffrey Skoller, who has retired after teaching in the Film & Media Department at UC Berkeley since 2005; Jaimie Baron, this year’s cocurator, presents her annual Festival of (In)appropriation.

series_2023_003,,,,What Has Been and What Could Be: The BAMPFA Collection,,,"What Has Been and What Could Be: The BAMPFA Collection inaugurates a year-long presentation of the BAMPFA collection, bringing a contemporary perspective to the museum’s global art holdings. With over 25,000 artworks, BAMPFA’s collection spans multiple generations and geographies. Organized into focused thematic sections, this exhibition emphasizes key strengths of the collection while also identifying areas for further reflection and growth. What Has Been and What Could Be showcases seventeenth-century Japanese scrolls, eighteenth-century European paintings by women artists, and American landscapes and folk art of the nineteenth century, alongside mid-century abstract painting, feminist art, quilts, and conceptual art. The works are arranged thematically across time periods, some revisiting familiar genres such as landscape and still life while others focus on pioneering work of women artists and East Bay artists. Another section showcases a significant group of works by Black artists that were brought into the collection in 1972. This exhibition strives to connect this expansive past to the urgent ideas and issues of our present. Bringing together works from disparate times and locales, it foregrounds the gallery as a space for questioning and expanding art historical narratives.",,,,,,,,,"June 7, 2023–July 7, 2024",Julie Rodrigues Widholm | Anthony Graham,,
