event_90006,,"Based on a novella by Dostoevsky, Une Femme Douce (A Gentle Creature) is framed by a flashback, the oldest device in film narrative, but here used to novel effect by a New Cinema master. A gentle wife dies, a suicide. Her husband, an antique pawnbroker, sits by the bed on which her body lies and reconstructs the past, in an attempt to (re)trace the paths which led his wife to this end. His attempts are foiled. He never knows. Neither do we. Bresson narrates the story of their relationship with his usual austerity, and breathtaking economy of style. As the wife, Dominique Sanda displays a degree of sensuality that is both tantalizing, in that Bresson refuses to exploit it conventionally, and totally unexpected. Une Femme Douce is also unique as Bresson’s first film in color, which is used subtly to stress texture rather than tone. As always with Bresson, the film is irresistibly moving in a way that is as hard to explain as it is to resist. 
Directed by Robert Bresson. Screenplay by Bresson from a story by Dostoevsky. Photographed by Ghislain Cloquet. With Dominique Sanda, Guy Frangin.

event_90008,Peter Von Bagh Presents: Two Adaptations of the Classic Finnish Novel Juha,"The Finnish critic Peter Von Bagh will present two adaptations of the neo-Romantic Finnish novel Juha by Juhani Aho. “The story tells of Marja, a former servant girl, who lives out of wedlock with Juha, who is distinctly older than she and plain simple-minded. Shemeikka, a traveler from Karelia, passes through and seduces Marja away, promising true love and excitement. . . . Stiller’s version centers on class barriers and the psychological conflict they condition. . . . In his adaptation of Aho’s “Juha,” Tapiovaara immediately found what was essential in the story: man and nature, a theme so often treated mechanically or superficially by the cinema, here finds expression worthy of its inspiration.” (Peter Von Bagh and Sakari Toiviainen) 
Mauritz Stiller’s silent Swedish-produced version of Juha will be shown in a beautifully restored 35mm print with the original red tinting—copied from a surviving nitrate print by means of a color analyzer. Stiller shot the film on location in Lapland, near the Swedish-Finnish border.

event_90023,Two Documentaries Produced by Jerry Seltzer: Jerry Seltzer In Person,"First Position was featured at the 1972 San Francisco Film Festival, where it warranted this notice by Albert Johnson: “A stunning documentary about the daily lives of several students at the American Ballet Theatre School in New York. It is not acted, and how William Reichert, the director, managed to get people to behave so unaffectedly before the camera is a total miracle. There has never been such an honest film about dancers-in-training before, and one is surprised at how untouched this absorbing milieu has been in cinema history. The film concentrates on four students, but one gets glimpses of such star-types as Nureyev, but in the role of student rather than god. There is also a suggested parallel between the major figures and a costume rehearsal of “Petrouchka,” with Michael Smuin, Diana Weber and Keith Lee.”

Photographed and Directed by Robert Kaylor, and featuring Charlie O'Connell, Mike Snell, and the stars of the Roller Derby, Derby was described by Albert Johnson in these terms: 
“A sociological document about the world of roller derby people, both participants and fans. Kaylor obviously started out to do a straightforward film about the stars and audience hysteria, but suddenly came upon an atypical American youth in Dayton, Ohio, who has only one ambition: to become a Roller Derby star. An entire picture of a section of middle-class American springs to life, and tremendous humor and pathos are involved in these observances and interviews—all intercut with the track races, spills and fights that make roller derbies such a phenomenon. It is indeed extraordinary that there is a microcosm of American youth with dreams of ball-bearing heroism in their eyes.”

","After the success of Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Jacques Demy attempted a much more ambitious musical film. In fact, in The Young Girls of Rochefort, he attempted nothing less than a full-scale revival of the all-star MGM singing-and-dancing musical of the fifties. Set in the French seaside town of Rochefort—repainted to look more like a set than a real location—The Young Girls of Rochefort is always entertaining to watch, and at moments it does create true movie magic out music, delicate romance, and incredibly attractive star-actors. Although the choreography is uninspired at times, the film is much better than most American critics held it when it was released in 1967. Michel Legrand’s music is just right for Demy’s artfully naive screenplay, and the actors are all charming, even when they are not fully credible (Gene Kelly). Andrew Sarris put his finger on it when he wrote: “With all that is wrong with The Young Girls of Rochefort, it is amazing how much pleasure it provides. I have enormous respect for Demy’s effort simply because it is so much easier to make a cosmic statement full of open-ended ambiguities than to turn out a reasonably entertaining musical.”

","“The elegant, beautiful film is already a classic. An adaptation of Charles Perrault’s fairy tale, Peau D’Ane stands like a jewel amid the jumble of realist cinema that dominates the attentions of film artists today. The imaginative touch of Jacques Demy and the exquisite musical score by Michel Legrand have brought all the elements of make-believe to a level of enjoyment unequalled by any live-action fairy tale on film (there are not many), and the cast is extraordinarily right. It must be emphasized that, too, that Peau D’Ane is experimental enough to have a tongue-in-cheek lightness in its presentation, for its innocence and belief in magic have a sophistication that adults will recognize with good cheer and a certain nostalgia for childhood visions.” —Albert Johnson

“The extraordinary film is in essence a ‘document’ about witchcraft based on the records of numerous trials from the 15th to the 17th centuries. Principal sequences: Satan (Christensen) seducing a witch-wife while her husband sleeps; a poor woman (Schoenfeld) is accused of witchcraft by the neurotic wife (Winther) of a sick man, is tortured by the Inquisition, and forced to admit participating in the Witches’ Sabbath. The film concludes with documented scenes of superstition and cases of ‘possession’ in 1920. 
“Treatment of this theme could have been both ridiculous and pornographic, especially in the explicit depiction of the Witches’ Sabbath. But Christensen’s style is more reminiscent of Bosch, Breughel, Callot and Goya. In the Inquisition scenes, fantasy gives way to realism and both the costumes and the composition of the images (by Johan Ankerstjerne) make one think of Dreyer’s Passion de Jeanne D’Arc. 
“The surrealists were especially enthusiastic about this unique masterpiece. Ado Kyrou described it as ‘the most powerful indictment of the criminal Church, its Inquisition and its instruments of tortue. The document should be shown in every school in the world.’” —Georges Sadoul, Dictionary of Film, University of California Press, 1972

Film historians rank his early silence and the great features of D.W. Griffiths as the first masterpieces of narrative cinema. His late silents, made in Hollywood with Lillian Gish or Lon Chaney, are less well known, although recent revivals of The Scarlet Letter, The Wind, and He Who Gets Slapped—all in our current series—have firmly established the reputations of these neglected American classics. The Scarlet Letter is notable for Sjostrom’s austere compositions black Puritan costumes against white New England snowscapes) and directional severity (a cold Nordic perspective on Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Protestant nightmare). Lillian Gish as Hester, and Lars Hanson as Dimsdale, give perhaps the finest performances of their careers. Hendrik Sartov’s photography survives the many generations of fading negatives that produced this print, enough to show that the most creative camerawork in American commercial cinema can be found in silent films.

event_90046,Two Films with Micheline Lanctot—Micheline Lanctot In Person! ,"French Canadian actress Micheline Lanctot was working as a film animator in Montreal when she was spotted by Quebec’s most prolific and acclaimed director, Gilles Carles, who casts her in the title role in The True Nature of Bernadette—the story of a Montreal housewife who one day takes her small son and walks out on her lawyer husband and bourgeois life to take off to the country and live a life of clean air, free love, and vegetarianism. Accused by some of being a whore, praised by others as a saint, Bernadette begins to discover her true nature as a free woman in Carie’s anarchist attack on conventional morality. Since her sensational debut in True Nature of Bernadette, Michaeline Lanctot starred opposite Jean-Luc Bideau in Tacchella’s Voyage en Grande Tartarie and opposite Richard Dreyfuss in Ted Kotcheff’s Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. She has also continued animating, working recently on Rick Williams’ Raggedy Ann and Andy, and designing the titles for Fun with Dick and Jane.

Equally good is the Swiss actor Jean-Luc Bideau, playing a man whose wife has been killed by a maniac on a shooting spree. Bideau is on a slow suicide trip around the alientating landscapes of southern French resort towns when he meets up with a fellow wounded human (Lanctot). The film continues to be about pain and non-communication, but the actors bring a fresh sense of life and humor to a situation which could otherwise have degenerated into a poor man’s Pierrot Le Fou.

No one but Bresson could use the constriction on commonplace expressiveness that wearing armor means; his great art has always thrived on constraints that he imposes on himself, and this film is a masterpiece of eloquent discipline. We’re seeing the knights after the early enthusiasm over the quest for the Grail that has been dampened. The chevaliers quarrel, the Round Table is ringed with chairs that belong to the now dead, and the film ends in a pile of armor in which one remaining figure faintly stirs: we are seeing the fading of chivalry in what amounts to a head of scrap metal that is the detritus of shrivelled code, and Bresson’s austere art entirely counterreacts with any feeling of bleakness. A film to see and see again; never have economies of composition, of editing, of expository ‘exciting’ climax, of bridging dialogue been more beautifully planned, or ended in such a sense of the copious.” —The New Yorker.

This great silent recalls its director’s earlier Swedish works where the same theme prevailed- man’s helplessness against the physical and mythic forces of his environment. Suggesting Murnau in its simplicity and sublime visual style, it lies somewhere between Greed and Treasure Of Sierra Madre on the thematic level, both for its pitiless exposition of human folly and sadism, and for its fatalism symbolized by an ever-present and dominating landscape. French film historian George Sadoul calls The Wind “a perfect masterpiece,"" and his colleague Jean Mitry writes: “Never was anguish more natural, more evident than in this terrible duel between the young woman and the wind, and never has tragic grandeur achieved a more moving simplicity.” MGM.

Mike, who recently moved back to New York, has released his first narrative film in years, Death Quest of the Ju Ju Cult (1976, 30 mins), a science fiction work with a touch of One Million Years B.C. and Things to Come, or, as his brother George writes: “. . . Mike never liked shooting in black and white until he started drawing black and white comic strips. This movie perfectly represents what he was striving for in his comic book art. It was shot in upstate New York in a style and pacing which is very much ‘him’ (as compared to ‘mine’ which bears its own signature . . . in grease pencil). I mention this only because when someone says the words ‘Kuchar brothers’ you automatically think of one homogeneous style of movie making, which is not the case at all.

In Wheeler Auditorium, $2.00","One of the most important American documentaries of recent years, Harlan County, U.S.A. is a gripping chronicle of the struggle of Harlan County (Kentucky) miners and their wives to achieve union recognition and basic human rights. The film focuses on the bitter 13-month strike against the Duke Power Company in 1973, but refers back to the “Bloody Harlan” strike actions of the 1930s. Barbara Kopple spent four years making this film, most of the time living and working with the people of Harlan County. And it shows. Seldom has a political documentary contained so many intimate and unaffected portraits of individual men and women engaged in class struggle. Harlan County, U.S.A. is scheduled to begin its San Francisco premiere engagement March 23 at the Surf Theatre.

As such it is a superb thriller, richly photographed by Ted Tetzlaff and well acted by a cast headed by Claude Rains as the Nazi leader and Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant as the secret agents charged with uncovering the German plot. However, on a deeper level, the film is an unusual study of relationships, focusing on the love two men share for the same woman and the conflicts each suffers when duty clashes with love. Rains’ Nazi villain, a mild-mannered man hopelessy in love with a taller woman and dominated by his mother, is a perverse and oddly sympathetic character that only Hitchcock could have conveyed so brilliantly.

Based on William Gibson’s long-run Broadway play, The Miracle Worker focuses on the monumental (one is tempted to say ‘Brechtian’) battle between blind, deaf, seven-year-old Helen Keller (Duke) and Annie Sullivan (Bancroft), the tenacious young woman who undertakes the seemingly impossible task of teaching her language and, by extension, bringing her into the civilized community. The Miracle Worker is a breathtaking drama, notable for one of Bancroft’s most impressive performances, and for its thematic resonances with Truffaut’s Wild Child and Herzog’s Mystery of Kasper Hauser.” —Michael Goodwin

In Wheeler Auditorium $2.50,"French film director Jean-Pierre Gorin (co-director with Jean-Luc Godard of Tout va bien, Pravda, Wind From the East, etc.) is more known in some circles as a gourmet chef than as a filmmaker. Hence the unusual angle of this appreciation by Gorin of John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate: 
“Among French ‘chefs’ John Frankenheimer’s reputation is solidly established: they consider him as one of their peers, i.e. a master. And this implies two things. First, that I would like J.F. to cook for us one of these days. Second, that great cooks may be the only movie experts we have in France. They may not known a damn thing about The Manchurian Candidate but they have felt subconsciously what cooking mastery it takes to process such a witch’s brew as this film. Take all the political anxieties of the ’50s (Korea, the Commies are comin’, brainwashing, rather fight than switch, gallows for the pinkos), add a heavy touch of Freudian schlock (Mom, why did you throw me out in the big wide world), turn the still-young Frank Sinatra into a Kung Fu expert, stir . . . and you’ll get—if you are John Frankenheimer—a moving tapestry which recaptures in a totally slapstick way some of the elements of our present times. Which tends to prove, against all preconceived ideas, that politics might be a short cut to poetics.”

Les jeux sont faits was his first foray into writing directly for the screen. . . . It is a beautiful controlled performance from Micheline Presle, a surprisingly good one from Marcel Pagliero, and a hauntingly melancholic score from Georges Auric at his Wagnerian best. . . . It’s a pessimistic film but—like a Keaton film—not a depressing one, since the pessimism is taken for granted. And there are certainly moments of joyful comedy—particularly from the magnificent Marguerite Moreno as the ante-room secretary to Sartre’s particular heaven—or hell.” —William K. Everson

When the Leaves Fall is typical of the best Georgian films in seeming light and low-key on the surface, until the satire begins to cut very deep. In a style similar to the Italian Ermanno Olmi, the film begins with observations of awkward adolescence in the story of a young boy who gets his first job in a wine factory. Soon he notices that the manager is fiddling his quotas, and eventually learns the hard way that corruption is the only way to get in by an economic system which works one way in theory, another in day-to-day practice.

Looking at Nights of Cabiria—arguably his best film—today, one sees no signs of the cancerous vulgarity which infected Fellini in the ‘60s and reached Ken Russell proportions in Casanova. In Nights of Cabiria, Fellini’s wife Giulietta Masina gives a very touching performance as a little prostitute living on the outskirts of Rome. Despite continuing hardships and suffering, Cabiria struggles constantly: for Fellini, the character symbolizes humility, trust and hope. In this film, Fellini achieves a purity of expression and a level of sustained pathos worthy of Chaplin.

event_90104,New Brazilian Cinema—Director Jorge Bodansky In Person! ,"The most important development in recent Brazilian Cinema is the emergence of a semi-documentary approach to the treatment of social and political themes in fictive films about Brazilian life today. The best film of this tendency—which runs counter to the dialectic/operatic approach of Glauber Rocha and the main Cinema Novo directors—is Jorge Bodanzky’s Iracema, which shows the “New Brazil” of the Trans-Amazon highway and the developing outback in images to graphic that the film has been banned from release in Brazil. Iracema (an anagram for America) is a 14-year-old Indian girl who leaves her village on the Amazon to find out what life is like in the big city (Belem). There she survives by prostitution, until she meets a truck driver on the Trans-Amazon Highway route who takes her on the road. For Iracema, the journey on the highway symbolizing the “new” Brazil of fantastic wealth and mobility leads straight back to the same misery and resignation. Both the young Indian girl (Edna de Cassia) and Paulo Cesar Pereio (as the truck driver) give extraordinary performances; and Bodansky’s color camerawork captures the beauty and squalor of Amazonia in riveting detail.

The Brain: A boy gets rid of his tormented brain, which takes off on its own; Tropicana Night Club: Love and jealousy among the late-night swingers; End of the World: A dreamy, documentary film-poem; Dole Man: Rehabilitated mental patient still loves bananas; The Brothers Who Gets Revenge: A Kung Fu Puerto Rican spaghetti western. 
All films are Super-8, and presented by Phillip Lopate, who helped the children make them and who is the author of “Being with Children,” a high-spirited account of teaching writing, videotape and theatre to children, published by Doubleday (1975) and Bantam Paperbacks (1976). 
This program was one of the highlights of last year’s Telluride Film Festival and was selected for this year’s Los Angeles Film-Ex. Phillip Lopate’s work with children inspired Stan Brakhage to call him “the greatest film teacher” he has ever known. He is continually asked to give workshops for teachers, and the Archive will provide an opportunity for this during Phillip Lopate’s visit. ",,,,,PFA Theater,1977-03-31,1977-03-31T21:15,
