0,7/1/1978,event_00001,4:30 PM,8:10 PM,,Two Films Produced by Barbet Schroeder: Eric Rohmer’s Third Moral Tale,La collectionneuse,,"“St. Tropez, a triangle (a woman and two men), in short the fourth of a series of six films which Rohmer grouped under the general title of Moral Tales. It goes without saying that the project owes everything to Literature. Rohmer seeks his inspiration in this Devil’s Triangle of 18th Century French literature which spreads between Vauvenargues, Choderlos de Laclos, and Restif de la Bretonne. La collectionneuse derives from these writers its perverse sensuality, its cruelty, its intelligence, and its sense of style. At times, nevertheless, one gets the feeling that it takes too much elegance to keep this film afloat. One step further, and the aristocrat who made La collectionneuse is going to turn into the flabby bourgeois who will make My Night at Maud’s.”—Jean-Pierre Gorin.

1,7/1/1978,event_00002,6:10 PM,9:50 PM,,Two Films Produced by Barbet Schroeder: Eric Rohmer’s Third Moral Tale,More,,"Barbet Schroeder’s first feature, before The Valley and Maitresse, occupies somewhat the same cultural position in European Cinema as that of Easy Rider in the American Cinema. At its American Premiere showing at the San Francisco Film Festival, Albert Johnson wrote: “The surprise hit of the 1969 Cannes Film Festival (out of competition), was a debut-work by Barbet Schroeder, one of the most progressive young producers in Europe today. Its subject-matter, the effect of drugs upon a young couple who settle down on the isle of Ibiza for freedom in love and sunlit self-discovery, is handled with somewhat more restraint than one encounters in American films. All attention is placed upon characterization and environment, and, in a very strange way, the effect is rather like a Hardy novel with freakouts. Stefan, a young German student, hitchhikes from Lubeck to Paris, where he immediately allows himself to be submerged in the intellectual vagabondage around the Boulevard St. Germain. At a party, he meets a calm, ultra-hip American girl, Estelle, and although she does not resemble the ideal femme fatale, it is only a matter of hours before Stefan and Estelle are vis-a-viscera under a marijuana haze. It is only when the youth follows her to Spain that the story shifts from simple love story to coldly horrific melodrama. Love becomes part of a drug-experimentation cycle, and Schroeder is not being philosophical. He is merely describing, with brilliant images and imaginative, sympathetic episodes, the total disintegration of an emotional relationship. In the character of Estelle, an entirely new concept of the American bitch-goddess is presented, and Mimsy Farmer is extraordinarily effective in her ability to exemplify a determined refugee from suburban comforts: the ex-sorority queen, grasping the hard-drug scene. More is an exquisitely beautiful film, and quite sophisticated in its approach to the Ibiza underworld and the dangerous degradations that are possible when drugged ecstasies are substituted by narcotic abuse. To some, the naivete of Stefan may seem amusing (for how many wish to remember what they were like before the Beatles of Haight-Ashbury:), but it must be remembered that out of this dying decade, there are many stories to be told, as truthfully as possible, about the confrontation of Young Europeans with the New World rebels, armed irresistibly with physical beauty, some smokes, some pills, and a needle.”

Everyone remembers Wilde’s epigrams, which were largely irrelevant to the plot, but Lubitsch redeemed Wilde’s silly melodramatics through the sardonic wit of his images and players.”—Andrew Sarris. “George Sadoul, dean of film historians, years later called it ‘Lubitsch’s best silent film, [full of] incisive details, discreet touches, nuances of gestures, where behavior betrays the character and discloses the sentiments of the personages. With Lubitsch a new art carried on the subtleties of Marivaux and the comedy of manners made its debut one the screen.’ Edmund Wilson, surely no movie fan, rhapsodized about it at the time, pointing out even its physical beauty: ‘He has clothed it in such beautiful photography and directed it with so much resourcefulness that he has turned out a very attractive film.’”—Herman G.

8,1/26/1978,event_00009,9:30 PM,,The Films of John Ford,The Films of John Ford (20),Tobacco Road,,"Every winning streak has to break sometime, and Ford’s broke on Tobacco Road. Based on a long-running Broadway play (3,098 performances between 1933 to 1941), the film version was aimed at the family trade, so screenwriter Nunnally Johnson had to clean up the original’s salty language, barnyard sexuality and backwoods degeneracy—hence throwing away everything that made the play interesting. The critics hated it, and even Fordian fanatics tend to find it mildly embarrassing. Too bad, not entirely Ford’s fault, you can’t win ‘em all—but why are we showing it?
We’re showing it because even lovers of Fordian comedy will not believe the sheer comedic momentum developed by this antic explosion of white-trash slapstick. Even the critics who hated in could not help exposing a grudging admiration for the very things they hated: “Jeeter has one decrepit jalopy that explodes as often as the trick clown-car in the circus,” wrote Time, “and when his son dude goes hog-wild with a brand-new Ford, the effect is of violent slapstick rather than a moron’s disregarded for mechanical decency.” Yes, yes! Maybe Tobacco Road was the genre prototype for Death Race 2000 and the rest of Roger Corman’s car-movies-as-demolition-derbies. —Michael Goodwin.

One of the finest of his “gereation” studies, its depiction of the relationship between a schoolteacher father (Chisu Ryu) and his son as the latter grows up is full of humor and understanding. According to Donald Richie: “No film before this 1942 picture had been so directly autobiographical and perhaps not had been so deeply felt.” Given the fire-bombing of Tokyo and General MacArthur’s attitude towards films made in pre-1945 Japan, it is a miracle that this and so many other Japanese films from this period survive at all, in any form: There Was a Father, so existing prints—including this one—have very poor soundtracks in places. However, the subtitles are new and legible, and the film is visible enough to provide a profoundly moving experience for those disposed to Ozu’s temperament.

Some of these ladies, including Marjorie Reynolds, Olga San Juan, Joan Leslie and Paulette Goddard, were not known for their terpsichorean talents and it is, therefore, rather surprising that Miss Leslie, a refugee from Warner Brothers melodramas, was among the best of the wartime heroines who danced with Astaire. Although Rita Hayworth was more glamorous, Columbia Pictures preferred to keep her in the realms of the femme-fatale, and she was prevented from continuing the promising relationship established in two Astaire-Hayworth films. The Sky’s the Limit is unique because Astaire choreographed the dances himself and obviously enjoyed working with Leslie, who is splendid in the fast-tap routine, “I've Got A Lot In Common With You,” and mildly languorous in the adagio to “My Shining Hour,” one of Harold Arlen’s most memorable ballads. The triumph of the film, however, is Astaire’s solo in deserted hotel bar, performed to Arlem’s mock-blues, “One For My Baby,” and this number remains, with its own perverse vandalism, the most entertaining destructive dance in history of film musicals. —A.J.

To some, it will be a total revelation to see Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in their first encounter onscreen (they were married soon after completion of this film) and to see Eddie Bracken at the start of his screen career. The script adapted from the Broadway hit, was a creditable job, but three of the original Rodgers and Hart score were scuttled in favor of some new tunes, sung by then-popular songstress, France Langford. The atmosphere of football rallies, horny gridiron heroes and lyrical outbursts is very apropos to contemporary Blue-and-Gold antics during the Fall season, and among the jubilant chorus boys can be seen the still-undiscovered Van Johnson. The dance numbers, performed mainly by Ann Miller and Hal LeRoy, are rhythmic and exciting, and, if college life was never really as naive and carefree as this, even way back in 1941 A.D., it bears within the mythical nostalgia of romantic youth in the groves of Academe, when the reality of exams and bluebooks had apparently not been conceived. —A.J.

For many viewers, Fuller’s critical reputation presents a puzzle, since his filmic virtues are frequently obscured by awkward scripts, amateurish acting, and shoddy production values. The Naked Kiss, however, provides no such obstacle to an appreciation of Fuller’s peculiar genius. Here, his intense vitality and bravure style are immediately revealed in the surreal opening sequence—a nonpareil cinematic shocker with a bald, half-naked hooker hysterically beating up her pimp. Constance Towers turns in a fine performance as a reformed, big-city prostitute who tries to find a new life in an all-American small town, only to discover the perversity and corruption beneath its bourgeois surface.

But the director was Joseph Losey, who added a great deal to the basic situation in terms of character observation and visual style. Finding the story trite and contrived, Losey tried to enrich the characterization: “Therefore, I wanted to make the artist a coalminer, and somebody who was self-made and still painted from the memory of his early experiences, and I wanted to use Stanley Baker as a Welshman who . . . is a natural antagonist to the English . . . and who was also working class, but who found himself caught up in a British class-structure of the most rigid old boy kind of set-up.” On the level of narrative, the film is tightly constructed and moves towards a denoument consistent with the over-all ironic treatment.

The heroine, Thérèse, is sensitively played by Emmanuelle Riva, while Philippe Noiret is excellent as the dull and uncomprehending husband . . . Therese is a film of shades and nuances, and Franju captures admirably the novel’s claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of deep regret at Thérèse’s inability to find happiness which is always so near and so inaccessible.” Seen today, this story, which revolves about the seemingly “inexplicable” murder attempt on her husband by Thérèse, can also be read as a psychological case study in women’s oppression.

A very “in” film among critics, Moonrise is little known or appreciated elsewhere. Andrew Sarris places it among the top five films of 1948, and British critic Gavin Lambert writes: “From the strong impressionistic opening sequence—a walk to the gallows intercut with a child in its cradle—the film is firmly handled: its rhythm, deliberately slow, never drags, the dialog scenes have a natural fluidity, and there is a brilliantly executed scene at a fairground . . . Moonrise proves the maturity of a most attractive talent.” Though Borzage made two or three more films after Moonrise, it was his last great work. Part of the reason for the film’s obscurity is the fact that it was made for Republic Studios, hardly an auspicious imprimatur for 1948. With Dane Clark, Ethel Barrymore, and Rex Ingram.

43,12/4/1973,event_00044,7:30 PM,9:30 PM,,First East Bay Showings! The Greatest Film of the New German Cinema—Das neue Kino! Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s,The Merchant of the Four Seasons,,"Background on The New German Cinema:
For the first time since the war, there is now an organized film movement in West Germany capable of challenging the completely rotten commercial cinema, and capable also of making films that stand with the best New Cinema in Europe, indeed which now stand in the vanguard of European filmmaking. There have been individual German films of quality since the war, and a few small attempts at a collective struggle against the mediocrity of the official film industry, but based on the number of quality made outside the studios in the last three or four years—most under the auspices of the Munich-based association of independent directors, Film Verlage der Autoren—it is not premature to hail some kind of a genuine film renaissance in the Federal Republic of Germany. One factor is surely the liberal attitude of German TV, which sponsors a number of daring projects for its cultural channels: there are also subsidies from the government in the form of cash awards for films of distinction. But another factor in this resurgence is clearly the political need in Germany for a cinema of social responsibility. As critic Amos Vogel points out, the primary tendency that unites all New German Cinema is “a linking up, on a modest yet mature level, with the great German left tradition of social criticism . . . every single film of the new German cinema seems to directly, indirectly, or by skillful metaphor take a stance of opposition, criticism, dissociation, tension vis-a-vis state, church, official education, police, profit motive, bourgeois individualism, the rat race, and the affluent consumer society.” Other common trends in these new and resolutely modern-looking films are the commitment to Brechtian techniques of narrative distancing, and an admirable modesty of scope and economy of means of dealing with concrete social subjects.
Rainer Werner Fassbinder
The word Brechtian is most often used to describe the methods of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the most brilliant and prolific of the young (he’s still in his 20’s) Munich-based directors of Das Neue Kino. Perhaps what is most original about Fassbinder’s method of achieving the Brechtian distancing effect is that rather than eschewing melodrama as the most reactionary form of bourgeois dramaturgy, he pushes it past its limits to a point where a genuine “alienation effect” comes out, as it were, from the other side.
Manny Farber, who will speak on Fassbinder before the screening of Why Did Herr R Run Amok at the PFA Theatre on Dec. 5 at 9:30, writes of Fassbinder in his lecture notes for his course in cinema at UC San Diego: “Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 26 years old, 11 films after having his own theatre, is the Munich Whiz Kid: writer-director of the hit film in each recent film festival. Similarly to Bergman, he has his own troupe of actors. Fassbinder creates a Kabuki-like form by working on image-pace-sound, an extreme stylization . . . done with sureness, rightness . . . his melancholy vision is involved in ritual, whether the filmed event is a family visit, small talk with an old friend, a dinner of co-workers. The ritual has horrendous effect on the inept, helpless main character who is utterly stupified and stifled by conventions and inevitable freaks out the bourgeois ritual is what annihilates the hero.”
The Merchant of the Four Seasons
Writing in last week’s Village Voice, Andrew Sarris offered this capsule recommendation of The Merchant of the Four Seasons: “This may be the finest German film since the Golden Age of Murnau, Lang, Pabst et al. in the years B. H. (Before Hitler). The word Brechtian has been tossed around so carelessly in recent years that it doesn’t begin to do justice to Werner Fassbinder’s remarkably controlled achievement in managing to break the heart without betraying the mind. Hans Hirschmuller, Irm Hermann, and Hanna Schygulla are names that don’t mean much right now, but in a few years Fassbinder’s stock company will be regarded as highly as Ingmar Bergman’s. So invest now in some cultural prescience.”
Sarris’ emphasis on Fassbidner’s stock company of actors is echoed in Roger Greenspun’s review which appeared in the New York Times:
“Her lips are cherry red, and when she smiles, they uncover even rows of pearly teeth. Beneath the soft swirls of her upswept blonde hair, her face all but radiates perfection. She is supernaturally beautiful—like an angel, or the goddess of some 1940’s movie. Kind, clear-eyed, compassionate; she is Erna, the good sister of Hans, the fruit peddler. And she figures—not too prominently—in Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s new movie, “Merchant of Four Seasons.”
I am interested more in her beauty than in her character (she is played by an actress named Hanna Schygulla, who, in fairness, deserves some of the credit) because it is a beauty that belongs neither to our time nor quite to our life.
Partly, it is from another time, the late 40’s, which suggests the style adopted by all the women who have any style in “Merchant of Four Seasons.” And partly it is another life, a life that is at once too bright, too warm, too vibrant; and at the same time too alien and artificial to be real.
If you can form a picture of Erna’s face you will have some notion of the style that pervades this film about Hans, who disgraces his middle-class Munich family by peddling fruit, whose big scrawny wife, Irmgard, is highly attractive to other men, and whose existence is a series of minor shocks and grinding disappointments. He suffers a heart attack, and changes his way of business and begins to succeed and to become a credit to his family.
And then his despondency really matures, and in the course of one sociable evening, knowing just what he is doing, he drinks himself to death—with toasts to everyone: family, buddies, wife, daughter and even the love of his life. . . .
The extraordinary range between the stolidy commonplace and the extravagantly romantic is one aspect of the imaginative freedom of Merchant of the Four Seasons. And it is such freedom that allows the film its intellectual playfulness, its seriousness, its furtive ecstasy, its spare realism, its cruelty, and its sometimes unnerving decency.
Mr. Fassbinder, born in 1945, is still very young, and incredibly prolific and probably the surest talent in the new German Cinema. He makes movies that look like nobody else’s, but that look like the discovery of a wonderfully idiomatic way to make movies. His work is neither easy nor ingratiating, but it is very exciting, and sometimes—as in the manifestations of the sublime Erna—moving beyond all expectation.”
The Merchant of the Four Seasons was one of the first films from the New German Cinema to become a huge popular success in German theatres.

At the end of March, in programs scheduled too late for inclusion in our monthly calendar, we had the honor of premiering Terayama’s two features with the director in attendance. Those who attended recognized the presence of an extraordinary anarcho-poetic talent in Terayama’s films. Because many PFA patrons did not have a chance to find out about these last-minute additions to our March programs, we are repeating the two features here and one June 17. Throw Away Your Books, Let’s Go into the Streets is far less disciplined than Terayama’s more personal second feature, Pastoral Hide and Seek, but it still remains a strikingly impressive film debut. It was hailed in Europe by Dusan Makavejev and others, and won the Grand Prize at the San Remo Film Festival, where Variety critic Hank Werba noted:
“In the fireworks display of technical variations that constantly pose a poor family’s disintegration at a time when all of society is trapped in its mad course towards affluence, the film opens a young adolescent son’s ambition to escape a social rut, establish his independence and live out life’s adventures. In this process, he succeeds only in wallowing through disillusionment. . . .
“The film is a virulent blast of outrage and revolt—heightened by apocalyptic colors and symbols—without overlooking the basic family characters of the boy, his sister, their father and grandmother. . . . Taken as a whole, Throw Away Your Books is a canvas of human tragedy and lower depth poverty, of rage and denunciation, of social fissures to be torn up and cleansed.” Directed by Shuji Terayama.

Signs of Life was his first film feature, and gathered this appraisal at the New York Film Festival: “Deceptively beautiful landscape and dangerous idylls on a Greek island during the German occupation provide the setting for Werner Herzog’s mysterious parable, in which a modern Don Quixote, apathetic and inhibited, is at last stung into rebellion against society and reveals the first senseless signs of his humanity only in insanity, as he pitifully lays siege to an unsuspecting town. A strange intense work by a new young director, influenced by Borges and Kafka. The hypnotic probing of cruelty, indifference and unspoken horrors becomes a metaphysical comment on man and his ideologies.” Written and directed by Werner Herzog.

He stops at a big house covered with honeysuckle vines. There he meets Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck). “You want to knock him off, don’t you baby?” The living-room of the Dietrichson home is cut with ribbons of light.

Laura is also the best film of an “autuer” whose subtle mastery of atmospheric “mise-en-scene” has been recognized and duly noted. Writing of Preminger in Movie, Eugene Archer describes Laura as “a classic, a perfect example of the detective genre. . . only now, two decades after its release, does the full significance of Laura become apparent. Like certain isolated landmarks of the American screen, it presages the future of modern cinema in its attention to the question of the ambiguity of the artistic viewpoint.” Writing in Film Culture, Andrew Sarris notes “Laura is Preminger’s Citizen Kane. . . . Preminger’s camera never takes sides even when the plot does. The fluidity of his camera never takes sides even when the plot does.

Westlake) novel, John Flynn’s The Outfit was produced by MGM when it was going bankrupt, and was poorly released, getting almost no critical attention. It’s no masterpiece, but The Outfit has some great character performances, tough dialogue, and good direction. A continuation of Point Blank (adapted from another Stark novel), The Outfit features Robert Duvall, Joe Don Baker, and Karen Black on a vengeance spree against The Organisation, controlled by Robert Ryan. British critic Richard Combs noted, in Monthly Film Bulletin:
“What does hold the film together rather more successfully is its skill in deploying a gallery of Hollywood character actors through the scattered episodes: Timothy Carey inimatably glowering as a minor thug; Richard Jaeckel as the mechanic doggedly reconstituting cars for a specialised clientele (“I just can’t make her sound like a Volkswagen”). And The Outfit is undoubtedly more faithful than Boorman’s film to Richard Stark’s particular view of underworld mores: a peculiarly brutalised atmosphere in which sentiment is either a psychological weapon (calling a victim by his first name) or is simply gratuitous. Early in the film, Macklin incapacities a would-be assassin by breaking a bottle across his face, interrogates him by shooting a parting through his hair, then escorts him solicitously to his car, lends him a handkerchief, and watches him depart with a muttered: “Die some place else.” (1973, 103 mins, color.

Writing in the Paris journal Postiff, Christian Vivinanni observed: “Experienced technician, fully at ease with the old format of genre cinema, nostalgic well before it became fashionable, alluding frequently to Hollywood’s past to which he devoted two films (Inside Daisy Clover and Summer of 42), deeply personal and introverted, giving the appearance of revealing fragments of his past with each new film, Robert Mulligan is neither a surviving Holywoodian nor an American on the move, nor a narcissistic intellectual. His work which goes on indifferent to fashions and commercial imperatives grows slowly but more and more surely: it is already one of the most fascinating and complex in modern American Cinema. The Nickle Ride which appears out of nowhere in the midst of a film noir revival, far from clearing up mystery and misunderstandings, will only increase them. A slow and ruminative thriller, in which violence and ironic nostalgia are equally effaced, The Nickle Ride could more readily be related to Bresson than to Walsh, if Mulligan—by his lack of pretension and pedantry—was not closer to the old Hollywood. One finds again in The Nickle Ride those same silent characters who refuse to open themselves up, who are locked in sadder and sadder solitude. The story is set in the Los Angeles underworld.

“Alfred Guzzetti has created a film about his Italian-American family’s memory of its past, a chronicle of ordinary life, marriages, births, deaths—made over five years on generations past and present, places here and abroad. He has synthesized living witnesses, old photographs, and a set of home movies that his father made. Although Guzzetti has described the film as a story without great events, without suspense and resolution, without historical magnitude, the film represents an important document of his ethnic origins. He keeps a very low profile in the film, concentrating the portraits on the first (his mother’s uncle) and second (his mother and father) generations. As the film progresses we begin to feel the continuity between the generations as well as the change. Particularly revealing are the political perceptions of his great uncle, a tailor, and the articulate awareness of his mother as an educated woman in the Italian community in which she grew up.” —Charles Lippincott (L.A. Filmex). Alfed Guzzetti, who has been making films since 1967, was Associate Professor of Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard University where he received his Ph.D. in English literature.

They are among many unknown female leaders throughout labor history. With good humor and a knack for storytelling, the women give personal accounts of the changes they and their co-workers went through: a growing awareness of working class oppression, of the second class status of women and minorities and of the clear need for collective action to win change. They recall the day of the first sitdowns, going to their first union meeting, organizing the CIO in the Chicago stockyards and facing police shotguns to fight the evictions of unemployed workers. A realistic sense of the period is fleshed out through a great deal of archival footage, stills and labor music of the 1930s and 40s. The film is a tribute to the courage and power of working class women everywhere.” —New Day Films. 
“This inspiring film will be a classic. It makes the 30s live through three militant, high-humored women, who relate how they helped organize shops 40 years before. No it’s not wide screen, not color. Hell with all that. It’s real. It makes you laugh, makes you cheer. It’s going to be shown through the years, to millions. . . . I hope every high school and college kid in the USA gets to see this film.” —Pete Seeger.
“This is the best film on labor history I have ever seen.” —Howard Zinn, Professor of History, Boston University.

The events in <i>8 1/2</i> are galvanized and made profound by startling representations (whose) sudden and unmarked entrance into the film becomes positively essential to a depiction of the crucial moments in the life of (an) artist who, despite his confusion and uncertainty, is making a supremely honest effort to understand himself and the springs of his creativity"" (Seymour Chatman).

His downfall, amid the ubiquitous whining of Doublethink, comes at the hands of the merciless inquisitor O'Brien, played with brute restraint by Richard Burton in his final screen role. Like the visionary landscapes of Blade Runner and Brazil, 1984 creates a totally airless, tyrannical world of its own. The all-pervading telescreens displaying Big Brother, the loudspeakers blaring out totalitarian maxims, the cramped, stark quarters where no pleasure is legal: this oppressive environment perfectly summarizes the sparse existence of its inhabitants.

One of contemporary Europe's darkest moments—the still-uninvestigated 1961 massacre of Algerian protesters in Paris—is meticulously reconstructed in director Alain Tasma's docudrama, a France-set counterpoint to Gillo Pontecorvo's legendary <i>Battle of Algiers</i> (1965). ""The night that never existed,"" October 17, 1961, was left out of French history books for over forty years. As the Algerian war came to its conclusion, the main Algerian nationalist group organized a massive demonstration in Paris against police repression and a local curfew; the chief of the Paris police (a man currently imprisoned for Vichy-era war crimes) responded by ordering a brutal crackdown. By the time the evening had ended, over 11,000 people had been imprisoned, and hundreds of protesters had been killed. A portrait of one night in France's history, <i>October 17, 1961</i> also serves as a window into the fissures that divide Europe today: between North African and European, immigrant and native, repression and assimilation. Inspired by the fiction/documentary blends of such socially committed British filmmakers as Alan Clarke and Ken Loach, and by the incendiary force of <i>Battle of Algiers</i>, director Alain Tasma reimagines an event that has been shamefully ignored in France's textbooks, but whose scars still linger. ""Thanks to the possibilities that fiction brings,"" notes the screenwriter Patrick Rotman, ""we have been able to dive into the past and to construct a narrative of many voices in which each character, be they an Algerian or a police officer, defends their own truth.

Embedded for over two years in three different regions, Longley uses an intimate cinema verité style laced with poetic juxtapositions to create three fully realized and truly cinematic portraits of life in Iraq today, its conflicts and problems and its landscapes, sounds, and beauty. In the heart of Baghdad, eleven-year-old Mohammed Haithem works as a mechanic to support his family, dodging burning buildings and roadside rubble while becoming swept up in rising anti-American sentiment and Shia/Sunni conflicts. Further south, in the Shiite-controlled area near Najaf, a young commander of the Moqtada al-Sadr brigades (now one of the most powerful and infamous forces in the country) leads a religious sweep of the area, imposing religious law by as much force as necessary. For a father-and-son farming pair in the Kurdish north, however, life passes a bit more simply, with the rhythms of nature as its primary influence. Uniting these three tales through an aesthetic that pays as much attention to color, light, and landscape as it does to politics, <i>Iraq in Fragments</i> flavors its insights with a beauty rarely seen in political documentaries.

In this seaside village given over to the spa trade, Christos is accepted as a friendly outsider by everyone but Manolis, who gradually becomes assimilated into the social environment of brutal, destructive machismo and rejects his friend completely. The matrix of family and community relations that makes homosexual love taboo, even for the homosexual, is delicately and complexly inscribed here. At its center is Manolis's mother, who knows and does not know at the same time.

O'Rourke's hook is the battle for land rights in Queensland, a region known as Australia's Deep South. Inhabitants of the continent for 60,000 years, the Aborigines find themselves marginal people in their own country. Dispossessed, they live on reservations where alcoholism is rampant and unemployment the major occupation. Much of the film's power comes from the hard-hitting narration by Aboriginal activist Mick Miller. Politically savvy and articulate, he speaks ""through"" the Aboriginal experience, condemning the abuse and desolation of a culture in ruin. O'Rourke reinforces Miller's insights with footage, some archival, illustrating the bitter ironies of alleged social reformation. Beer-swilling rednecks profess their vulgar superiority while, in the bush, Aborigines, garbed in cowboy attire, try desperately to retain their customs. ""...Couldn't Be Fairer"" leaves you in the vertiginous space between disdain for boorish white society and remorse over the collapse of Aboriginal culture. -Steve Seid",,,"Directed and Photographed by Dennis O'Rourke.

The mother/daughter/mother cycle is seen as one of habits and patterns unwittingly inherited. In stopping to ask questions, filmmaker Patti Bruck knowingly slips away from the cycle. Twenty years ago, Camille Billops put her four-year-old daughter Christa up for adoption. In 1980, the 22-year-old Christa located her mother. Billops and James Hatch's Finding Christa (1991, 55 mins, Color) uses reconstructions and documentary footage to trace the mother's and daughter's attempts to find each other amidst anger, ambivalence, and contradictory expectations.

Street battles in South Africa, figure skating in Canada, tornadoes in Kansas are transported to our living rooms via the evening news, giving us the illusion that ""we are there."" While the ""content"" of the news may be in the commentary, it is the visual images which seem to ""guarantee"" its veracity. However, some of the earliest newsreels were faked. Some like Georges Méli&egrave;s' The Dreyfus Affair, reconstructed important events of the time. Both fanciful and factual, the footage ""visualized"" Dreyfus' trial for those who had no access to the ""real thing"", a democratic notion not shared by the French government which banned the film until 1950. While The Dreyfus Affair might be termed a docu-drama, tonight's program also includes early footage of the Boer War and the Battle of Santiago Bay released as newsreels, but created far from the actual events-the privileging of the visual realm taken to an extreme. Keith Sanborn's An appearance and a public statement re-presents kinescope footage of ""live"" tv coverage following Kennedy's assassination, prior to Johnson's inauguration; it is ""dead time"" (and as such contrasts with the fast-paced, short news segments of the ""usual"" evening news) considered newsworthy out of the television practice of covering national crises, even when ""nothing"" is happening. In The Eternal Frame, Doug Hall as Artist-President Kennedy re-enacts the Zapruder footage of the motorcade in which JFK was shot-footage so massively and repeatedly witnessed that it seems to constitute a national memory. Creating images of images, this T.R. Uthco videotape explores both the power and limits of representation in a society whose access to world events is primarily through television-through mediated experience rather than direct encounters. Nick Gorski, who has worked in tv news for almost ten years, collects ""found"" images from the tv newswires which he then manipulated in RESOLUTION: a tv trilogy. In Gorski's ""broadcast,"" the corporate world is saluted by world leaders, the weather is magically orchestrated by weathercasters, and the competitive spirit breaks out of the sports world. As Gorski comments, ""It's all video, you're not involved AT ALL. You're not there, and you're not doing ANYTHING.""

In the last weeks of World War I, a dance craze and body mania overtook the German-speaking world. The beginnings of New Age spiritualism strangely blended with nudity, nature worship, and eroticism. Finally freed of kaisers, censoring boards, and simplistic attitudes about the role and place of women in the modern world, German artists and performers looked to the cult of the body. Among Central European intellectuals, these various physical culture schools, modern dance regimens, ""scientific"" religions, and shocking cabaret productions were collectively called Ausdruckstanz (or Expression Dance). Ways to Strength and Beauty (1925), long celebrated for its scenes of male and female nudity as well as its kitschy educational frame, is the most important filmic document of Ausdruckstanz. From theatrical presentations to the utopian city of Hellerau to Berlin cabaret, no motion picture has more authentically captured the body madness of Weimar Germany, as it prefigures the Nazi aesthetic. We will also view slides and clips featuring dancers of the twenties including Anita Berber, the most provocative and innovative nude dancer during this heightened consciousness of female sexuality.

Because we see images of reality, we tend to think of them as mirrors on the world, forgetting the chain of decisions that led to our viewing these particular images. The reality of the image is that someone chose to photograph the scene (as opposed to another) and to frame it (leaving what out?); someone edited the sequence making further decisions as to what to include and discard, and which images to place next to each other; a commentary was written ""anchoring"" our reading of the images; and the news stories were ordered, hierarchized and categorized. Tonight's film and videomakers intervene in this circuit of exchange of visuals and information to present an alternative vision of the world. In L'Histoire du Soldat Inconnu, Belgian filmmaker Henri Storck uses newsreels filmed to commemorate the Kellogg-Briand Pact deploring war and edits them to satirize the event: meaning is not in the image, but in its use. Bruce Conner's Report uses footage and a news broadcast of Kennedy's assassination and clips of newsreels and ads-the content of a news program, reworked and edited into a report on power, commenting on the authority of public figures and public images. From his video series for television, Six Fois deux, Jean-Luc Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville's Photos et Cie is an investigation of the news photo, and the company it keeps: the technological, economic and ideological factors that contribute to its construction. In one section, a sensational still photograph meant to catch the eye, is held before us for an interminable period as a monologue reveals the choices involved in its ""capture"": the selection of film stock and camera and the choice of the moment to shoot. Later, Godard flips through a stack of photographs, and in asking who gets paid, when and for what, he foregrounds the economic determinants of the images. The final section comments on the irony of the French Communist Secretary calling a news conference to criticize the media. -Kathy Geritz",,,"L'Histoire du Soldat Inconnu: A film by Henri Storck.

While they share a gender, and a mother is always a daughter, these roles are often articulated through their separation rather than their similarities. For those who came of age or into awareness in the seventies, a sense of identity almost inevitably translated into not becoming one's mother. Less recognized, or perhaps less acceptable, is the fact that mothers also questioned the cultural construction of motherhood. In the films presented tonight, through autobiography and fiction, mothers and daughters see the reflection of ""I"" in ""you,"" a likeness with difference.

Alf Bold programmed The Arsenal in Berlin and selected films for the Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival; Douglas Edwards founded Encounter Cinema at UCLA and was Theater and Special Events Administrator at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; Gary Essert was the founding director of Filmex and Artistic Director of The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles; Stephen Harvey was a noted author, film critic, and Film Curator at The Museum of Modern Art in New York; Ron Haver was Director of Film Programming at The Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The films and clips chosen for tonight's program were among the personal favorites of each programmer. Both Alf Bold and Stephen Harvey made their own selection of films by which to be remembered. From Alf Bold's program, we present three short films, Half a Life, Valse Triste, and Two Tars; from Stephen Harvey's program, we present clips of Distant Voices, Still Lives and Miracle in Milan. From a recent tribute at The American Cinematheque, we have selected a few of the films which Gary Essert introduced to Los Angeles audiences at Filmex: Quasi at the Quackadero, Guacamole, The Club, and a feature, The Ascent.

The tracing of connections between mothers and daughters traditionally has held little social meaning. In fact, repression of this bond has been seen as a necessary step toward becoming a woman. Naming and inheritance, law and social standing have customarily descended along paternal lines. Tonight's selection of films emphasize the vertical nature of female genealogy, and the possibility of speaking in terms of different origins. In Roberta Cantow's Clotheslines (1981, 32 mins, Color/B&W), a domestic task, the hanging of laundry, takes on social and symbolic significance as a ritual passed from mother to daughter, binding them to each other. Lynn Kirby calls her Love, Lynn (1982, 1 min,) ""a poem to my Mother and Grandmother.""

She teaches Chicana/o studies and women's studies at the University of California at Davis. In Hollywood films, the often interchangeable image of Mexican and Mexican American is traditionally that of the ""other,"" whether exoticised, criminalized, or patronized. The silent so-called ""greaser"" films (1908 to 1918) portrayed the persistent stereotype of the violent ""greaser"" who roamed the Southwest during the period of border conflict between 1848 and 1930 (New Mexico and Arizona became states in 1912). These movies also offered an image of the redeemed-but still marginalized and ridiculed-""good greaser"" as a prescription for Chicanos, as Chon A. Noriega, editor of Chicanos and Film, notes. Tonight we present: Greaser's Gauntlet (D. W. Griffith, 1908, c. 15 mins), in which a Mexican man who ventures north is saved from a lynching by an Anglo heroine; Licking the Greasers (Francis Ford, 1914, c. 27 mins), a Shorty Hamilton western in which Shorty runs guns for Mexican revolutionaries; and Broncho Billy and the Greaser (Broncho Billy Anderson, 1914, c. 15 mins, From EmGee), in which Broncho Billy's Mexican wife Lolita attempts to run off with her Mexican lover. (Silent, B&W, 16mm, From Library of Congress except as noted) Trial (Mark Robson, USA, 1955) A second subgenre of Chicano-oriented films is the social problem film of the thirties to the sixties. Trial is a particularly fascinating example for its anti-Communist subtheme. The trial of a Chicano adolescent on a trumped-up rape-murder charge becomes a political football between Communists and racial bigots in a Southern California town. Glenn Ford is the law professor whose cynical partner on the case (Arthur Kennedy) intends on making a martyr of the boy to raise money for the Communist Party. Of course it could be said that the novel and movie did the same, lacing a story of justice for Mexican Americans with the prevailing anti-Red preoccupation, for a predictable big box-office response.",,,"Written by Don M.

He has performed on various electronic instruments throughout the United States, Western Europe and the Soviet Union, and toured with Anthony Braxton’s Creative Music Orchestra. His music has been described in the <i>New York Times</i> as “a shifting, dappled patchwork of sounds that combine in clusters, circle each other in a kind of wary counterpoint...indescribable overlays that each seem to carry a specific emotional weight.” Award-winning animator Pierre Hébert, of Montreal, experimented in the sixties with the phenomenon of retinal persistance in such films as <i>Op Hop</i> (1965); but he may be best known to PFA audiences for more recent films including <i>Memories of War</i> (1982) and <i>Etienne and Sara</i> (1984).

From early newsreels to the tv news, there has been agreement as to what makes a ""good"" news story-who the main characters are, where the action is, how the plot evolves. Some of the earliest films were of news events; termed ""actualities,"" they purported to show the world as it was. But as Early Films of Interest shows, only a small fragment of the world was considered ""of interest"": famous people, violence and catastrophes, sports, and staged events, such as speeches, parades and press conferences-the mainstays of newscasts to this day. This reel of early news coverage includes footage of the funeral of Queen Victoria, the San Francisco earthquake, the first Wright flight in France, as well as a recreation of a famous prize fight. While distinctions continue to be made between objective and subjective treatments and documentary and fictional forms, in practice, things aren't so simple. Through the staging of events for the camera, the selection and editing of footage, and the scripting of commentary, the news has a fictive element; it is less about an ""actuality,"" than a story about reality. We stay tuned for upcoming ""news stories,"" not ""news facts"". The narrative conventions implicit in storytelling, whether anecdotal, fictional, or news, are the subject of Nina Fonoroff's The Big Story. The soundtrack, a circular cycle of stories about stories, consists of fragmentary statements complexly intercut with comments from a speech by Spiro Agnew; and together with the densely worked image track, literally layers public and private realms, fictional and documentary renderings into a fantastic story about ""a small group of men"". Ken Jacobs describes his Perfect Film as a ""TV newscast discard, 1965; reprinted as found maybe in a Canal Street bin, I guess, with the exception of boosting volume second half."" In it, an eyewitness reports on an assassination attempt to various news organizations. In take after take, he relates what he has seen. In the re-telling, the qualifications (""seems to be..."") disappear and his story, the so-called facts take shape. When an official gives his version of the ""news to date,"" he stumbles, and then begins again at the beginning. In this unedited version, we witness the power of access to the media to literally control one's image. In The Amarillo News Tapes, Doug Hall, Chip Lord and Jody Procter, ""Artists-in-Residence"" at KV11-TV in Amarillo, Texas, report on the local news, sports and weather...and the operation of a small town news agency.

The laying on of hands offers the power to heal, and hands on piano keys perform astonishing pyrotechnics. Prosthetic hands take on a life of their own, and disembodied hands scuttle across floors to strangle their enemies. Hands act as instruments of cross-cultural and extra-terrestrial communication.

Each technique produced a new boundary that came to supplant the original limit, the surface of the human body. This lecture tracks the development of cinema, psychoanalysis, and X-ray photography in relation to the concept of the surface. Although these techniques offered a means of traversing the human body, they also inscribed the function of the surface at another location-the screen. The irradiated photographic plate and the cinematic and psychoanalytic ""screen"" can be seen as extending the body beyond its traditional topology.

Our concern with emotional candor and real freedom connects us with the underground cinema of the sixties which also challenged the boundaries of acceptable subject matter.

By 1915 all this changed: D.W. Griffith gave us not only his landmark The Birth of a Nation, but a film substantial enough to inspire a protest movement. Out of Birth were born censor boards and ordinances across the country. Not one to turn and run, Griffith quickly turned the censor wars into the linchpin of the film's marketing campaign-making brilliant publicity out of personal encounters with protest groups and state legislators. What he learned with The Birth of a Nation, he applied to his wartime epics, Intolerance (1916) and Hearts of the World (1918), baiting his adversaries and demanding the same rights for movies that had been granted earlier art forms.

The world photographed and the world presented in the final film are related, of course, but as a dream relates to reality, or an atlas to the world. Tonight's films, travelogues and ethnographies of the near and distant, include representations of familiar sites and constructions of creative geography: worlds seen and worlds dreamed, represented through the properties of film emulsion and the imagination of the filmmaker. Once captured on film the world may be controlled, domesticated, or it may be left wild, remote and ambiguous...unreal. The surrealist-influenced film collages of Joseph Cornell construct imaginary worlds with found travelogue footage where the distant and the nearby, the primitive and the everyday are part of the same fantastic journey. Adrian Brunel's Crossing the Great Sagrada, a 1924 found-footage film that subverts and parodies travelogues, has recently become available. Ken Jacobs' Orchard Street was exquisitely observed, and exquisitely preserved in Kodachrome, in colors which make everyday reality seem like Kansas in the Wizard of Oz. It is shown tonight in the original Kodachrome workprint. His recently completed Opening the 19th Century: 1896, is a 3-D treatment of footage originally shot by the Lumi&egrave;re Brothers. While the illusion of three dimensionality seems to further the Lumi&egrave;res' desire to bring the world home, in Jacobs' hands, the world is made wonderously magical rather than more ""real."" Vincent Grenier's World in Focus moves between three- and two-dimensional representations, a world at our fingertips, yet out of our grasp. In Mark Lapore's remarkable The Sleepers, shots of New York's Chinatown and northern Africa are presented in separate vignettes. The worlds filmed are observed, recorded, and yet, like the three figures depicted lying in different beds, sleeping or reading, their ""consciousness"" is inaccessible to us, the viewers.

Drawing on the writings of such thinkers as Gregory Bateson, Jacques Derrida, and Martin Heidegger, Hill doesn't illustrate or comment on their ideas so much as vex or unsettle them. As he has said, ""I want to suspend the either/or relation of sense to nonsense; see what happens inside the experience of language, as meaning is taking root or being uprooted..."" Tonight, Hill will talk about the agitation of meaning as it coils through his current work. Video clips of his works will be presented.

They provide an inheritance-the desire to create, access to the past, stories to reinterpret, and the possibility of change. In Anna Campion's family drama, The Audition (1990, 24 mins, Color), Jane Campion, the filmmaker's sister, auditions their mother for the role of a schoolteacher in the film An Angel at My Table. One senses that the resulting unease is actually with their roles of mother and daughter. Gunvor Nelson encounters the past through her gaze at her mother, bedridden in the present, in Time Being (1991, 8 mins, B&W). Su Friedrich questions her mother about her life in Nazi Germany in The Ties that Bind (1984, 55 mins, B&W). Friedrich's questions are scratched directly into the surface of the film. One writes, the other speaks, one asks, the other answers. While the roles of mother and daughter are rethought so that both teach and learn, create and interpret, the sense of ambiguity is inescapable. Friedrich can imagine another story, told by a mother more political, more like herself. And yet her mother's experiences intensify both of their personal perspectives.

His dense, precisely edited works vary in length from seconds to no more than ten minutes, and date from the 1950s to the present. Noel Carroll has characterized Kren's early work as revealing a ""Méli&egrave;s-like fascination with the mechanisms of cinematic fantasy."" His films from '64 to '67 were made in conjunction with performances by the Direct Art movement in Vienna, particularly Gunter Brus and Otto Muehl. These works were purposefully assaultive and taboo-breaking, and have been described as fighting repression with regression. They remain startling and shocking in their depiction of the naked body as material. His later, more mysterious work continues his use of complex strategies, yet his use of expressive poetic images startles differently-with the shock of seeing the possibilities of the image anew, as he superimposes disparate times or sifts through different readings.-Kathy Geritz Note: All of Kren's film titles are preceded by two numbers; the first indicates the film's chronological order, while the second indicates the year it was made.",,,,,,,,,1964,,,,,,,,,1994-02-15,,

She studied art, including painting and sculpture, both in Lima and in London, and has worked in the British film industry as an editor. Lowder describes her films as being ""concerned with visual research in art and in society in general."" These films are silent, many of them composed frame-by-frame in the camera. She discusses her films in the following notes: Parcelle (1979, 3 mins): ""The French term 'parcelle' refers to a fragment, particle or bit. Filmed frame-by-frame in the camera, the film rests upon the alternate appearance and duration of tiny colored squares and circles placed on a black background. Inserted in series between plain white or colored frames, the particular arrangement of the items on separate frames forms, when projected on the screen, certain visual relationships producing a specific perceptual experience. Champ Proven&ccedil;al (1979, 9 mins): ""The film presents in succession, from a single viewpoint, a frame-by-frame construction of a peach orchard with pink blossom (April 1), with green leaves (April 16) and with red-yellow peaches (June 24). Retour d'un rep&egrave;re composé (1981, 59 mins): ""(In Retour d'un rep&egrave;re (1979)), the procedure of separating and extracting certain aspects of a scene by adjusting the focus of a series of frames in succession according to various organizational patterns is developed.... While the filmic operations are structured in relation to a limited space (a branch over a duck pond), the filmic process rests on a visual transposition of a pantoun, a verse form taken from literary rhetorics, which characteristically transforms itself gradually and continuously in a precise manner.... A double print version of Retour d'un rep&egrave;re led to the film Retour d'un rep&egrave;re composé. (Here) the same material is presented successively in the form of three slightly different versions: a straight single print, a combined picture printed twice onto the same film strip (the second printing another tone and shifted back one frame), and a combined image printed thrice onto one piece of film likewise. Each version reorganizes a means of approach to the perception of the composed visual image. 'Composed Recurrence' is a rough translation of 'Retour d'un rep&egrave;re composé' except that one loses the aspect concerning 'rep&egrave;re' (a point of reference). Scenes de la vie fran&ccedil;aise: Avignon (1986, c. 15 mins): ""One of a series of four films filmed in Arles, Paris, La Ciotat and Avignon over several years. The films originated from the fact that as a filmmaker and film programmer I tend to travel often to certain places. I became intrigued by their familiar changes throughout the seasons. Soon, there being too much material for one film, each town became a film. In Avignon, I attempted to incorporate the transformations by combining on an ordinary printer identical viewpoints filmed at different periods: the market, the main bus stop, rue des Teinturiers from my bathroom window, the Rh&ocirc;ne river, a park, a little square.""",,,"All films by Rose Lowder.

Artists have combined text and image for a variety of reasons, from an appreciation of typography to a desire to multiply discourses. Tonight and next Tuesday we present films that use text and image to examine some aspect of sexual discourse. In tonight's program, the use of written text allows the artists to make connections, to analyze power within social and political contexts and, crucially, to use language to realign power by disconnecting words from their traditional usage. These artists say ""violence,"" ""homophobia,"" ""pleasure"" where others have said nothing. It perhaps isn't surprising to find such concern with (re-)defining terms in feminist and lesbian/gay cinema. With the power to name and describe comes the power to make visible a world. Richard Kwietniowski's humorous alternative gay alphabet exposes not a parallel vocabulary but an oppositional one (Alfalfa, UK, 1987, 9 mins). In Seven Lucky Charms (USA, 1992, 16 mins), Lisa Mann contextualizes one woman's response to repeated spousal abuse, and implicates viewers in a rethinking of their own place within power relations. Yann Beauvais' AIDSIDA (sid a ids, France, 1992, 6 mins) links the treatment of AIDS in France with institutionalized, systematic homophobia.

With mock dispassion 1 Berlin-Harlem describes the dispiriting months between a black G.I.'s discharge and his reluctant return to the United States.

Filming by special permission, Depardon offers the first look at the workings of a French court, where the camera is never allowed.

As the decade progressed, poetic, vibrant formal explorations paralleled and overlapped with the personal tradition as seen in George Kuchar’s <i>Wild Night in El Reno,</i> Bruce Conner’s <i>Take the 5:10 to Dreamland,</i> and Abigail Child’s <i>Ornamentals.</i>",Kathy Geritz,,"<b>Dufus!</b> (Mike Henderson, 1970, 8 mins, B&W, From Academy Film Archive). <b>Promise Her Anything But Give Her the Kitchen Sink </b>(Freude, 1969, Color, 3 mins, PFA Collection). <b>Confesssions</b> (Curt McDowell, 1971, B&W, 16 mins, From Canyon Cinema). <b>Dyketactics</b> (Barbara Hammer, 1974, Color, 4 mins, From Canyon Cinema). <b>Chinamoon</b> (Barbara Linkevitch, 1976, Color, 15 mins, From Canyon Cinema). <b>Miss Jesus Fries on Grill</b> (Dorothy Wiley, 1972, Color, 12 mins, PFA Preservation Print).<b> Wild Night in El Reno </b>(George Kuchar, 1977, 6 mins, Color, From Canyon Cinema). <b>Take the 5:10 to Dreamland </b>(Bruce Conner, 1977, 5.5 mins, PFA Collection). <b>Ornamentals</b> (Abigail Child, 1979, 12 mins, Color, Silent, From Canyon Cinema). <b>Weltschmertz</b> (Joe Gibbons, 1979, 15 mins, Super 8 transferred to Digital Video, From artist)<br /><br />&bull; (Total running time: 97 mins, 16mm, unless indicated otherwise)",,,,,,,,,,,,"The experimental turns personal in this collection of vibrant, comic, and transgressive works from the seventies, including pieces by George Kuchar, Barbara Hammer, Freude, Bruce Conner, and others.

Subjective vision, celluloid materiality, irreverent spontaneity, found footage, formal exploration, and social critique were reclaimed and often combined, distinctively and expressively, into single films. This program includes the post-Brakhagian intimacy of Peter Herwitz’s <i>The Mysterious Barricades</i>; the devil-may-care silliness of Rock Ross’s <i>Vespucciland: The Great and Free</i>; Gunvor Nelson’s witty conundrum, <i>Field Study #2</i>; and Mark Street’s mesmerizing industrial film deconstruction, <i>Winterwheat</i>. It ranges from Charles Wright’s ecstatic collage of image and sound spaces, <i>Sorted Details,</i> to the stinging critiques of homophobia in Jerry Tartaglia’s <i>Ecce Homo</i> and the trauma of women giving birth in Janis Crystal Lipzin’s <i>Other Reckless Things</i>.

A film–within–a–film, or perhaps more accurately without–a–film, Schmidt's no-showbiz spectacle concerns an ailing librarian (Ed Nylund) who's determined to restage Edna Ferber's <i>Showboat,</i> but with a vengeance: ""I want to bring the stench of death to the musical comedy."" The filmmakers rented a large hall in San Francisco and publicized an open audition. Across the seedy stage comes every manner of whacked–out performer: a nun who does a striptease, a dancing turtle, a drag queen singing the Beatles; they are infiltrated by recognizable San Francisco performance artists. Of course, the film gets no farther than the casting call, as the ""actors"" rebel against this showboating scam. <i>1988–The Remake</i> doesn't mock its spectacle by preying on the curious cravings of the cast; rather, it explores the function of fantasy, offering a few fond words at film's end: ""Be the star in your own life.""",Steve Seid,,"Written by Schmidt, William Farley, Henry Bean, Nick Kazan.

Every year on May 4, the Dutch commemorate the victims of World War II and those who have fallen in conflicts or peace missions since 1945. In this quietly affecting documentary, Honigmann follows diverse individuals through the day of remembrance, assembling fragments of stories and unearthing the conflicted emotions of those who remember—a survivor of a Japanese prison camp, the daughter of a Nazi collaborator, a Hungarian refugee—and those who cannot, including a teenager for whom the war is almost beyond imagining. As an interviewer Honigmann is engaged but not intrusive, coaxing out important reflections but allowing others to remain unspoken; “I don’t want to talk about it” becomes a familiar refrain. On this day, a speaker at a memorial ceremony declares, “we are free to be silent.” The strains of Mozart’s Requiem following the titular two minutes say as much as any words.",Juliet Clark,,"Photographed by Maarten Kramer.
