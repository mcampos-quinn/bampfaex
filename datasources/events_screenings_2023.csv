events_2023-10-11_005,"Sunday, Feb 5, 2023",7:30 PM,,Full,,Full: The Hunger Moon,,,"The February moon is the hunger moon. It reigns over a time of surrender and renewal of that which nurtures us and gives us new life. Poets Rachelle Escamilla, Lourdes Figueroa, and Leticia Hernández-Linares pay homage to love in all its manifestations. Coraza plays indie folk pop. Attendees receive a hunger moon gift to take home.

Rachelle Escamilla is a Chicana poet from the Central Coast of California. Her award-winning first book of poetry, Imaginary Animal, has been rereleased as a second edition with a foreword written by poet Manuel Paul López. Escamilla is the founder of a number of creative writing and poetry programs in the United States and China and was the producer and host of the longest-running poetry radio show in the United States. Her article “Searching for my Family,” about her grandfather’s testimony to Congress in 1969 about the working conditions for migrant workers, was published by the Library of Congress.

Lourdes Figueroa is an oral poet. She received her MFA in creative writing with an emphasis in poetry at the University of San Francisco. Her work has been published in Mirage, The City Is Still Speaking, Something Worth Revising, Elderly, Eleven Eleven, and Blush-lit; her chapbook Vuelta is forthcoming. Her work continues to appear locally and in faraway villages. In 2020 she and her wife, Peggy Peralta, launched Bilbil Projects, a space where poems and film come together.

The daughter of Salvadoran immigrants, Leticia Hernández-Linares is an interdisciplinary, bilingual writer, artist, and racial justice educator. She is the author of Mucha Muchacha, Too Much Girl, and Alejandria Fights Back! (¡La lucha de Alejandria!). She was in the inaugural YBCA 10 artist cohort and was the coeditor of The Wandering Song: Central American Writing in the United States. A five-time San Francisco Arts Commission grantee, she teaches in the College of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University.

Coraza is a feminist indie folk-pop group based in Oakland. With roots in Chile, Guam, Mexico, and the Philippines, Coraza’s sound is a unique fusion of experimental and traditional; nostalgic and provocative, combining elements of South American folkloric style with catchy contemporary rhythms, bilingual lyrics, electric distortions, and delicious harmonies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MK Chavez
events_2023-10-11_006,"Friday, Oct 6, 2023",6:00 PM,,Performances,,Self_Less with ensemble PHASE,,,"Self_Less is a multipart series of musical works examining our “sense of self” while questioning the uniformity of these perceived feelings. Composer Edward Shocker brings together a cross-cultural collaborative team featuring performance group ensemble PHASE from Korea, experimental film projectionist Keith Evans, and playwright Erik Ehn. Incorporating live music and projected and prerecorded audio of stories from people who have had unique neuropsychological experiences (such as dementia, out-of-body experiences, and episodes of depersonalization-derealization), Self_Less’s mission is to bring awareness to the connections among brain, body, mind, and self. Ensemble PHASE performs excerpts of Self_less: The Crossing and Songs of Undoing

On an everyday level, a unified sense of self can be taken for granted. We wake up in the morning, feeling comfortable and in full control of the physical body we are inside. We are able to make our breakfast, and while doing so, we recollect what we have done in the past and what we plan to do later that day and further on into the future. Yet even within this sense of “linearity,” many people have experienced events that have taken them out of their normal state of mind. These experiences, whether lasting only seconds or for an extended period, have had profound effects on the people who have experienced them. Self_Less investigates these moments when we feel we have crossed over to glimpse an alternate state of being and uses abstract images, music, and storytelling to reflect the emotions and experiences for the audience.

Edward Schoker explained: “""For many years I have been interested in our experiences of crossing over to other states of mind, whether this is through simple ‘daydreaming’ or a more profound experience. I believe these experiences help us understand our ‘sense of self’ and are perhaps even needed in our lives. My goal is to create a musical piece that projects the feelings and sensations associated with these experiences.”
About the Artists

Edward Schocker is a composer and performer who creates music with made and found materials and alternate tuning systems. He is the cofounder and director of Thingamajigs, a Bay Area arts and education organization devoted to alternate methods of creating sound and art. Schocker’s music has been performed at Stanford Lively Arts, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Internationales Klangskunstfest in Berlin, Cultural Station Seoul 284, and Youkobo Art Space in Tokyo. Over the years, his projects have been supported by UNESCO, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Japan-US Friendship Commission, the California Arts Council, the Korean Traditional Performing Arts Foundation, and New Music USA. Currently, Schocker is an ensemble member of the Thingamajigs Performance Group, creating work in a group process with Dylan Bolles, Suki O’Kane, and Keith Evans.

Keith Evans makes films, performances, and installations that bridge the space between cinema and sculpture. His works include whimsically repurposed items like turntables and telescopes. Film becomes reframed as one element in combination with music, movement, and constructed tableaus. Evans’s creations frequently explore ideas of nature, science, and history. Much of his work belongs to the genre of “performance cinema,” described as “an exciting and emergent genre of avant-garde moving-image art . . . arguing for the embodied, collective consideration of real-time, site-specific media experiences. . . . Performance Cinema practitioners create immersive spectacles of sight and sound, opening a space for questioning and contemplating visual culture through direct activation of the senses” (Gray Area, 2016).

Erik Ehn is an American playwright and director. The former dean of theater at CalArts, the California Institute of Arts, he is also the former head of playwriting and a professor of theater and performance studies at Brown University. Ehn is cofounder and co-artistic director, alongside Lisa Bielawa, of the Tenderloin Opera Company in San Francisco and also an artistic associate of San Francisco’s Theatre of Yugen. He is a cofounder of the Regional Alternative Theater (RAT) movement, an international network of alternative theaters. He was a recipient of the Alpert Award in the Arts in 2002 and a Whiting Award in 1997.

ensemble PHASE is a group of musicians with a longtime passion for experimental projects, creating and performing new repertoires through experimentation on Korean instruments with various musical materials and artistic forms.  The group actively performs traditional and contemporary repertoires, collaborating with living composers and performers from diverse musical backgrounds. In order to expand interest in writing for Korean instruments, ensemble PHASE has also given workshops and lectures for composers and students to help them better understand Korean music and instruments, inside and outside of Korea. Since 2017 ensemble PHASE’s projects have been sponsored by the City of Seoul, Seoul Foundation of Arts and Culture, Art Council Korea, National Gugak Center, and Studio Paju.

These works address issues of migration and the overuse of pesticides and their impact on farmworkers, consumers, and the environment.

Born in California’s San Joaquin Valley to a Mexican/Yaqui farm worker family, Hernández is a UC Berkeley graduate and an internationally acclaimed San Francisco–based visual artist best known for her depiction of Latina/Native women through her pastels, prints, and installations. Her work reflects social, political, ecological, and spiritual themes.

Catherine Wagner discusses her work The Arctic Circle IV, part of a photographic trilogy in three distinct areas: scientific machines (Frankenstein), the Arctic Circle, and the history of science. As the artist sees them, Arctic Circle landscapes touch at once on the limits and nature of human accountability, social alienation, and even life itself. Over the course of her career, Wagner has observed built environments as a metaphor for how we construe our cultural identities, examining institutions as various as art museums and science labs, the home and Disneyland.
