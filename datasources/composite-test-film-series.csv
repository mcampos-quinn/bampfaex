ser_00081,7/1/1977,8/1/1977,,Treasures from the UCLA Film Archive,,,"The UCLA Film Archive was founded in 1968 by the Motion Picture Division of the University of California to integrate the study of film-making with the resources of film history. Since then the UCLA Film Archive has become one of the nation’s major centers for film study. The “treasures” of the UCLA Film Archive consist mainly of original 35mm prints (over 3000 currently on deposit), of American films produced in the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Both 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures placed with the UCLA Film Archive their nitrate vault prints. These prints are available for study on editing tables at the UCLA Film Archive, but have never been projected in a public exhibition program on such a scale as our series will provide. The purpose of our Treasures From the UCLA Film Archive series is twofold: (1) to dramatize the need for film preservation in this country and (2) to provide our patrons with an opportunity to SEE what the classic American films from the past really looked like, through the projection of original 35mm nitrate prints, or first generation 35mm safety prints. Our series include more than 100 features, and will run through October 11. In the latter part of the series, we will publish a catalogue of the exhibition with essays on film preservation problems today and notes on the films shown. Proceeds from the box office receipts for these programs will go directly towards the cost of preserving (i.e., transfering from nitrate stock to safety film) the Number One film on UCLA’s list of preservation priorities, Frank Borzage’s 1930 version of Molnar’s Lilliom, which we will show on August 17. There are many titles in the UCLA collection which we cannot show in this series, as UCLA’s positive nitrate prints are the only materials in existence: they must be transfered to safety film before they disintegrate, and before they can run the risks of shipment and projection. We hope in future years to be able to project a number of these unique prints which are now awaiting preservation, more exactly, awaiting the funds to accomplish preservation. It should be remembered that once an original nitrate print has been preserved, there is no reason not to show them in places like PFA which are equipped to project nitrate film: in fact, there is all the more reason to project these original prints, as they are doomed to chemical decomposition whether or not they are projected—so they should be seen while they still exist.
We also look upon this program as an opportunity to begin a closer association with our sister film archive within the University of California system. We hope that members of the campus communities in LA and Berkeley will benefit from the coordination of the unique resources and particular areas of expertise of UAM/PFA and the UCLA Film Archive. We are grateful to Bob Rosen, Bob Epstein, and Charles Hopkins of the UCLA Film Archive for making possible this opportunity to present such a large segment of America’s film past in undiminished visual glory.

ser_00086,10/6/1975,11/19/1975,,Japan—History Through Cinema,,,"Presented in Association with the Japan Society of San Francisco, and The Japan Film Library Council, Tokyo
This series of twenty films was conceived by Mrs. K. Kawakita of the Japan Film Library Council to give a panoramic view of Japanese history as reflected in important works in the Japanese Cinema. Japanese films are usually shown without any kind of historic context and it is the rare film-goer who knows in what period a Japanese jidai-geki (period film) is set. This season of twenty films can only hope to reveal a small part of Japan’s rich and complex history, but together with our recent series for public TV, The Japanese Film, this kind of undertaking can be of real value for cinematic as well as socio-economic-historic reasons.
This festival traces the growth of Japanese society from the third century to today. As Japan followed a deliberately isolationist policy during most of its long past, the earlier films in the series furnish a valuable insight into its development. The films in the second part are concerned with events in the 20th Century, and give an inside view of the political and economic developments that led to its becoming the world power it is today.
A separate booklet on Japan—History Through Cinema, published for this series by the Japan Society of San Francisco, will be available. The notes for the films in this series are by Tadao Sato, Donald Richie, Goro Iiri, Hiroko Govaers, Ken Wlashin, and Claire Kitson.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ser_00088,10/7/1975,12/10/1975,,The Films of D. W. Griffith,,,"Presented in Association with The Museum of Modern Art
On the occasion of the Centennial of the birth of D. W. Griffith, The Museum of Modern Art presented a massive two-part retrospective of Griffith’s films, which took place earlier this year in New York.
This major retrospective of America’s most important film creator was made possible with the assistance of the National Endowment for The Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts.
During the period October 7—December 4, we will present sixteen separate programs selected from the Museum’s mammoth retrospective.
The Museum of Modern Art has stipulated that single admissions may not be charged to any of these programs. Therefore, we are selling series tickets only. One series ticket entitles the holder to attend all 16 programs in the series. Series tickets are available for purchase at the PFA Box Office during normal box-office hours. The cost is $15.00 for UC Students and Regular Members of PFA; $20.00 for those holding $.50 yearly PFA viewing memberships.

The series included many titles that are unavailable to many exhibitors, or are available only in worn 16mm prints. Through a Grant from the Exxon Corp., The American Film Institute has been able to make new 35mm prints of all titles in the series, and The University Art Museum’s Pacific Film Archive is the exclusive outlet in the Northern California region for this AFI-Exxon Outreach Program. The titles to be shown in February include The Major and the Minor (1942), My Favorite Wife (1940), Sullivan’s Travels (1943), Miracle of Morgan Creek (1944), and Miss Tatlock’s Millions (1948).",,Presented in Association with the American Film Institute Under A Grant From The Exxon Corp.,,,,,,,,,,
ser_00091,1/17/1978,1/17/1978,,"The Films of Robert Kramer (and Friends) or, a History of the Movement as Viewed from Within",,,"Robert Kramer’s films cannot be separated from the new left political movement of the late 1960s. Kramer appeared in the 1965 film Troublemakers as an SDS organizer in the Newark Community Union Project. He traveled in Latin America in 1966, gathering footage of the Venezuelan guerrillas that became F.A.L.N. In 1967, he traveled to North Vietnam with Norm Fruchter and John Douglas to film People’s War. In January 1968, Kramer helped found Newsreel, a self-consciously militant organization that set out to produce agitation and propaganda for the coming American revolution. Later that year, Kramer again appeared as an SDS strategist at the Democratic Convention battles in Chicago in the Newsreel film Agitation & Propaganda #505 or Summer ‘68.
Despite his involvement in political struggle and documentary filmmaking , Kramer’s own films are primarily scripted dramas. The characters in these films reflect the political upheaval of the 1960s, but do not refer to specific events, groups, or individuals. Instead, Kramer’s feature films explore the interior upheavals of the Movement, the effect of political alienation on the consciousness of young radicals. 
It’s important to see the documentaries and features together to make sense of Kramer’s work. Just ten years ago, the times were very different. The war was an inescapable presence, brought to you in draft notices, body counts, nightly news reports, and government assurances that the enemy was finally exhausted. The perception of racism changed in the minds of the white radicals from a question of civil rights to a basis for black revolution. Kinds began to smoke dope and live together. The government, the old social order, was the enemy.
Ten years later, it’s rather fashionable to point out the petty-bourgeois basis of this revolt, and take for granted that the Vietnamese would eventually win. For the characters in Robert Kramer’s films, all was not so apparent.
The early features, In the Country, The Edge, and Ice, are about the difficulty of taking effective actions to revolutionize America. Much of the country was torpid, innured to the horrors of war and racism at home. Kramer’s revolutionaries operate in a social vacuum, cut off from the working class and the accepted social network of the country. They simply assume the need for immediate armed revolt; the questions that remained involve strategy, tactics, and personal courage.
The early features are essentially about the personal and political adolescence of the Movement—characters under the stress created by their urge to rebel and their fear of the consequences. Viewed today, the pervasive sexism and male posturing in the films will make the audiences uncomfortable. Male potency is a theme in each of the films, both directly and symbolically through the loving fascination with this respect, The Edge and Ice parallel the living fascination with guns that swept one wing of SDS months before the Weatherman split. Kramer’s camera probably caught much more than he ever intended.
Clearly, he records only a thin slice of the Movement, characters whose class backgrounds give them no preparation for the trauma of war and blatant racial oppression. With an aversion to political theory and only bourgeois ideology to fall back on, Kramer’s characters fall prey to undifferentiated moral outrage at the brutality of the world. Their response is a romantic pursuit of assassination and guerrilla warfare. Most of us kept those fantasies carefully tucked away in our heads during those years. Weatherman acted upon them, and Robert Kramer had the audacity to put them on film.
The early films of Robert Kramer are well-crafted psychological studies that complement the political documentaries of the time. The late features—Milestone and Scene from the Class Struggle in Portugal—show the growth of Kramer’s political vision as he records the changes five years have brought to his Movement friends, and then returns to the documentary format to film the Portuguese society in transition. —Thomas Brom.

ser_00092,1/25/1978,4/3/1978,,The Films of Yasujiro Ozu & The Family in Japanese Cinema,,,"As we noted in our January 1978 Program Calendar, our retrospective series of films by Yasujiro Ozu includes many accompanying features from a circulating program—The Family in Japanese Cinema—organized by the Japan Society and the Japan Library Council. This juxtaposition of two retrospectives should allow interested viewers to discover the similarities and the notable differences in the approaches of Ozu and lesser masters to the theme of the family, to the genre of the home drama which is so predominant in the Japanese Cinema. As Donald Richie notes: “All countries make films about families, but only Japan has made so many. There are such numbers of films that each family member has his own genre. There are ‘hana-mono’ about mothers and ‘chichi-mono’ about fathers: there are ‘tsuma-mono’ about wives and ‘o-jo-san’ movies about daughters; there are various genres about sibling relationships, two of the most popular being the ‘ani-imoto’ relationship between the older sister and her ‘ototo,’ or younger brother. The sheer number of such films indicates the importance of the family as a basic cinematic theme and suggests the importance of the family as a basic fact of Japanese life.” The features that will accompany Ozu’s include several rare works from the rich but still largely unexplored pre-War period of the Japanese Cinema.",,Presented in Association with the Japan Film Library Council,,,,,,,,,,
ser_00093,2/10/1978,2/10/1978,,James Card Presents,,,"James Card needs no introduction to PFA audiences or to anyone involved in film culture in this country. One of the first American film archivists, James Card brought his collection of over 800 titles to the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography in 1949. From that point until his retirement in 1977, Card served as the Director of the Department of Film at the prestigious Rochester institution. Between September 9 and November 30, 1972, we presented a major retrospective of Treasure From the George Eastman House, marked by Card’s presence at the opening programs. In November 1975, Card returned to present a smaller selection of Eastman House Treasures.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ser_00094,2/13/1978,2/13/1978,,The Films of Ernst Lubitsch,,,"In February and March, we will present a survey of the career of director Ernst Lubitsch (1892–1948), the man Orson Welles described as “a giant . . . his talent and originality were stupifying,” and whom Greta Garbo called “the only great director out there.” A central artistic figure in both the German silent cinema, and the American Cinema of the ’20s, ’30s, and ’40s, Lubitsch is best known as a master of sophisticated humor and visual wit, though his range matches that of any director who ever lived. Applying the patented “Lubitsch touch” to adult subject matter, he could, according to Charles Chaplin, “do more to show the grace and humour of sex in a nonlustful way than any director.” Though far from complete, our retrospective will be complemented by individual screenings later in the year, “and every year,” of titles not featured in this section, which combines a series of Lubitsch’s German silents being circulated by the Goethe Institute with a group of new 35mm prints of nine American titles struck by the American Film Institute thanks to a generous grant from Exxon Corporation.",,Presented in Association with the American Film Institute and the San Francisco Goethe Institute,,,,,,,,,,
