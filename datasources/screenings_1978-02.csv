2/1/1978,6:00 PM,,The Films of Yasujiro Ozu & The Family in Japanese Cinema,,Ino and Mon,Ani imoto,"Ino and Mon was made in 1936, and is an adaptation of a prize-winning novel by Saisei Muro. According to one Japanese critic: “Director Kimura successfully transfers the psychological density of Muro’s prose to the screen by drawing on the natural characteristics of his actors. Akaza, who oversees basket-making near the Tama River, and his wife Riki, have three children. The oldest, his son Ino, is a stonecutter, while daughters Mon and San are sent to work as maids in Tokyo households. Mon is sent home, pregnant. The whereabouts of her lover, a college student, are uncertain. The family’s reaction, particularly that of Ino, illustrates the crude gut-level emotional base of family ties.” (Translated by Alan Poul).                                                        Directed by Sotoji Kimura. Based on the novel by Saisei Muro. With Yoshio Kosugi, Yuriko Hanabusa. (1936, 60 mins, 35mm, English titles)",,,"Directed by Sotoji Kimura.

2/1/1978,7:30 PM,9:30 PM,The Films of Yasujiro Ozu & The Family in Japanese Cinema,,Late Spring,Banshun,"“Ozu’s home drama, however, is of a special sort. He neither affirms the family as, for example, Keisuke Kinoshita does in his later films, nor condemns it, as Mikio Naruse does in many of his films. Rather, though Ozu creates a world that is the family in one or another of its varied aspects, his focus is on its dissolution. . . . The dissolution of the family is a catastrophe because in Japan—as contrasted with the United States, where leaving the family is considered proof of maturity—one’s sense of self depends to an important extent upon those with whom one lives, studies, or works. An identification with family (or with clan, nation, school, or company) is necessary for a complete identification of self.” —Donald Richie, Ozu
In Late Spring, a father feels he is keeping his daughter from marriage; when she is erroneously told that her father is thinking of re-marrying, she agrees to an offer. Donald Richie is not alone in considering Late Spring “one of the most perfect, most complete, and most successful studies of character ever achieved in the Japanese Cinema.” The farewell trip to Kyoto, in particular, must be numbered among Ozu’s most moving sequences.

2/1/1978,7:30 PM,,"The Films of Robert Kramer (and Friends) or, the History of the Movement as Viewed from Within ",Robert Kramer in Person!; Admission $2.50,Milestones,,"Five years after the guerrilla fantasies of Ice, Robert Kramer and John Douglas turned the cameras on themselves, their friends, and on characters like them. Milestones begins with the scripted remembrances of an immigrant woman clothing worker approaching death, and ends three hours later with the birth of a child in a Northern California commune. In between, some 50 interconnected characters play both their scripted roles and themselves, revealing more by what they do than by the improvised lines they are speaking. 
Kramer’s subjects are the sons and daughters of the bourgeoisie, on the whole alienated from their families and class, but still very much in tune with bourgeois values, sensibilities, and privileges. Ranging from filmmaker to potter, organic farmer to draft resister, acupuncturist to isolated political organizer, these characters retain an incredible social mobility. They pass easily in and out of the bourgeois world, accepting poverty and working-class life only as long as it suits them. It’s amazingly schizophrenic, fascinating to watch, and utterly true. 
Milestones has been damned from its narcissistic and sentimental view of the Movement, but its disparate cast characters—now in search of their families, their history, and themselves—are painfully close to home. “The process of making Milestones was the process of getting mobilized again. Others arrive by different routes.” (Robert Kramer) —Program note by Tom Brom. Written, Protographed and Directed by Robert Kramer and John Douglas. Lighting and Sound by Philip Spinelli.

2/2/1978,4:00 PM,,Yvette Biro Presents Contemporary Eastern European Cinema,Presented in Assoication with The Center of Slavic and East European Studies; admission free,A Report on the Party and the Guests,,"This series has been programmed by the visiting Hungarian film critic and script writer Yvette Biro, who is presently teaching in the Group Major in Film at Berkeley and in the Department of Communications at Stanford. Ms. Biro will speak briefly before each film screened in the series, and has provided the following note on this celebrated film by Jan Nemec, who is presently living in Los Angeles where he hopes to find the possibility to resume a brilliant career cut short by the events of August 1968 in Prague. Nemec belongs to the metaphorical filmmakers of the Czech New Wave. Diamonds of the Night, and his short segment of the episodic film Pearls at the Bottom—based on Hrabal’s short stories, made with Chytilova, Jires, Menzel and Passer—set him apart from the realistic trend: a touch of the surrealistic and fierce, unexpected elements distinguish his work. But it was the Report that revealed Nemec’s full range of talents. It is a labyrinth-like parable, difficult to penetrate, within the framework of an apparently innocent country picnic. A satyrical, cruel tale, it abounds with symbols, where the Kafkaesque absurd is mixed with the poetic influence of Czech surrealism. The message: in order to survive in a world which it is not easy to cope with, one must learn to play the game, or at least learn to fake it.

He was the first Black African to graduate from the important Institute des Hautes Etudes Cinematografiques (IDHEC) in Paris. He had appeared as an extra in Autant-Lara’s Devil in the Flesh (1947), but his cinema debut as a director came in 1955 when he made his thesis film C’etait il ya quatre ans, which, though made in Paris, is rooted in Africa, and as such is regarded as the earliest Black African film. Aside from making more than 30 films, mostly documentaries sponsored by the government, Vieya has also worked as production manager/producer on many of Sembene’s films: as a critic/historian he has published several important texts, including “L’Afrique et le Cinema” (1969), “Ousmane Sembene,” Cineaste (Vol. 1, 1972), and “Les Cinemas Afriques des Origines a 1973” (1975). 
This program will include the following short films:

2/2/1978,9:30 PM,,The Films of John Ford,The Films of John Ford (21),How Green Was My Valley,,"Ford’s back-lot re-creation of family life in a Welsh mining town won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Photography, Best Actor and Best Art Direction—beating out Citizen Kane in every category! If hindsight makes that seem silly, the fact remains that Valley provided Ford a splendid opportunity to work into his on-going preoccupation with the social dynamics and metaphoric resonances of family life. The film’s strengths lie there, and in its rich, novelistic tone, and in a series of strong, understated performances by Roddy McDowall, Donald Crisp, Rhys Williams, Walter Pidgeon and others. If Valley is less than entirely satisfying, there are still moments of tremendous impact, in which one can sense Ford’s total emotional involvement—not the least of which is the epilogue, in which the family is reunited (if only for well-deserved curtain calls). —Michael Goodwin

Robert Kramer and Philip Spinelli spent seven months in Portugal, working with members of the Proletarian Revolutionary Party (PRP) to gain a vantage point on the developing class struggle. 
The pace of the editing and the amount of narrated detail are exhausting. Kramer examines each facet of the political and economic situation both at home and in the former colonies, trying to understand a revolutionary process that is speeding by him. 
An old radical woman provides a sense of continuity through the two years of struggle. Kramer and Spinelli criticize the entrenched parties, including the Communists, for slowing down the spontaneous movement of the working class. Through the PRP, they have access to clandestine meetings of the Revolutionary Brigades attempting to arm the peasants, and the SUV revolutionary forces within the military. But the forces of the right consolidate, and Kramer must end only with a statement—A luta continua, the struggle continues.  
Eclectic in style and sometimes confusing, Scenes from the Class Struggle in Portugal is nevertheless beautifully filmed under very difficult conditions, tightly edited, and courageous in its attempt to capture on film the incredible complexity of a whole society in turmoil. —Tom Brom. Directed by Robert Kramer and Philip Spinelli. Produced by Barbara and David Stone. (1977, 90 mins, color, Print Courtesy of Robert Kramer)

Ousmane Sembene in Person!  $2.50,Ceddo,,"Ousmane Sembene’s most recent film was featured at most of the major International Film Festivals in 1977, including Cannes, Berlin, Edinburgh, and London. The British critic Nigel Andrews noted: “Ousmane’s Sembene is the Senegalese director who made The Money Order and Xala, both seen in London, and whose portraits of graft, greed and corruption in colonial Africa are the nearest thing the modern cinema has given us to Jonsonian comedy. Ceddo is a story of power politics and religious squabbling in an African tribe: the three-way tussle between Christianity, Muhammedanism and the tribe’s own religion being brought to a head by the kidnapping of the chief’s daughter. Who will prove the power of his faith by winning her back? Sembene steers the film expertly from the comic pomposity of early scenes to a bloody and all-too-plausible finale. He is also, being African himself, one of the few directors with a licence to suggest that black men can sometimes comport themselves in no less corrupt or dimwitted fashion than white man.” 
Sembene himself has stated of Ceddo: “Ceddo is a film of reflections. The film presents facts and events from an epoch stretching over hundreds of years and which is still with us today. Reflections on the appropriation of power. Anticipations of the coups d’etat of the Africa of today. Reflections on the guilt of the former feudal classes and the bourgeoisie of today. Reflections over the responsibility—direct or indirect—of religion for the alienation of the African—even today. Reflections over the slave trade where the toys and trinkets of today were objects of exchange. Reflections on the spirituality of the African.”                             Written and Directed by Ousmane Sembene. Photographed by Georges Caristan.

The story concerns an elderly family patriarch, a likable self-centered man of the old world with fragile pretentions to social distinction, who receives a money order from Europe, only to find himself faced with a maze of bureaucratic red tape to cash it. Finally, the lawyer who helps him cash it winds up with the money order as his fee. The film is a comedy which slowly turns into a tragedy: the satire is sharp, and is conveyed by caricature (the new bourgeoisie, the imitation-French civil servants) and the situation (the old man winds up lamenting that “honesty is a sin in this country” and vows to become dishonest so that he can survive). Technically, the film is first rate, with the color photography particularly beautiful.

2/7/1978,9:15 PM,,"Senegal: Fifteen Years of an African Cinema, 1962–1977",Xala; Ousmane Sembene in Person!,Xala,,"One of the most sophisticated works of the new African cinema—at once both comic satire and a deadly accurate polemic against the black bourgeoisie of Dakar. An elderly bureaucrat, El Hadj Aboubakar Baye by name, has become rich, corrupt and complacent as one of the money-hungry ministers of commerce. Not only does he possess a thriving private business, a new Mercedes-Benz (washed only with bottled Evian) but two wives as well. It is El Hadj’s decision to take a young woman as a third wife that engulfs him in lively complications of the plot. His children by the first wife are outraged by the humiliation to their mother; the second wife, a modern glamor girl, is seemingly more interested in the arrangement of her Afro-coiffure and material possessions than anything else. As for the child bride’s family, they imagine themselves black versions of the French “haut monde.” Sembene introduces the problem of El Hadj’s sudden impotence as a dramatic surprise, and when the luckless hero seeks a cure for this “Xala,” the ancient codes and customs of Senegalese life clash violently with the present, leading to a shocking and memorable climax. Symbol and reality merge, with touches reminiscent of Bunuel: one suddenly realizes that in Senegal, perhaps, the prisoners are happier than the peasants. —Albert Johnson

But these characters’ faults are unfolded simply and unaffectedly, making one feel sentimental at the same time one sees how unbearable they are.

It is a sobering, often shocking account of the origin, ascendancy, and destruction of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. According to Leonard Rubinstein, in his essay “ Fascism Revisited”: “Erwin Leiser’s Mein Kampf is probably the best general approach to the problem of Nazi Germany, with an able historical view that is not overbearingly dramatic. Although the roots of Teutonic fascism may lie in the formation of Prussia as a military state by Frederick I, it seems safer to begin, as Leiser does, with the 1914–1918 war which destroyed monarchist and upper-middle-class Europe.” (1960, 119 mins, English narration)
Wake Up, Germany! (Deutschland, erwache!)
Originally shown on West German TV in 1968, Erwin Leiser’s Wake Up, Germany! is a compilation film made up of sequences from feature films produced during the Third Reich. Leiser has skillfully assembled this material around one theme: propaganda in the film of Nazi Germany. In the preface to his book Nazi Cinema, written as a supplement to Wake Up, Germany! (and available in English from Collier Books), Leiser states: “My film was confined to showing the use of feature films in the openly political propaganda programme of the Third Reich. The totalitarian system’s abuse of the mass media demonstrates just how necessary is the democratic social structure and the right to freedom of information which that system opposes . . . .
“There is very little commentary, and only occasionally are the distortions which these films make juxtaposed with the truth. These sequences, which I have classified as propaganda and arranged in some kind of order, are in themselves enough to expose the workings of National Socialist propaganda. To have presented them more explicitly would only have prompted some kind of emotional reaction, and might thereby have activated in many viewers a defense mechanism and a readiness to suppress the truth. Because things are left unsaid in the film, the viewer is placed in an emotional vacuum and obliged to adopt a personal, critical attitude towards the material. It is thus impossible for an audience to identify unthinkingly with either the propaganda contained in the film sequences or with my own comments. No value judgments are made; this is left to the viewer. There is no mention of names, since it is the subject which is important. The material must be judged in a contemporary light.”

According to Amos Vogel: “A poisonous lyricism—anti-romantic and reflective of the truths of the 20th century—permeates his inexplicable charades of inexorable cruelty, submission, betrayal, and repression, in which victims and oppressors constantly change places and no one remains uncorrupted by the exercise of violence. Beginning with Round Up, his best, Jancso’s stylized tragic-epic works have all concerned themselves with the problems of power and oppression, in images of searing plastic beauty and in sequences of implacable violence and terror set against ominous, brilliant landscapes of the most cruel black and white. These are visual metaphors of truths better expressed obliquely, the anguished statements of a pessimistic humanist haunted by the problem of totalitarianism, war, and the corruption of power.”

2/9/1978,7:30 PM,,,Special Preview Screening! That's My Advice to You; Mitchell Block in Person!,That's My Advice to You,,"Mitchell Block, director of the award-winning “docu-drama” on rape, No Lies, and professor of film production and criticism at California State University at Fullerton, will appear with his latest film, still a work-in-progress (we will be projecting the film in double system), in a special preview screening. It is hoped that this will provide an opportunity for filmmaker and audience to exchange ideas which might contribute to the film’s completion, and involve the viewer in the filmmaking process. Appropriately, That’s My Advice to You deals with the process of becoming a feature film director in Hollywood and in so doing, presents a realistic portrait of a complex and difficult industry in all its parts. Presented in a series of revealing interviews, the cast includes such Hollywood notables as director Martin Brest (Hot Tomorrows); director Roger Corman, president of New World Pictures; TV director Joan Darling (Mary Hartman, MASH and feature film First Love); director/writer Samuel Fuller (Pickup on South Street, Steel Helmet, The Big Red One); director Jonathan Kaplan (White Line Fever, Mr. Billion); agent Robert Littman (Ken Russell, Nicholas Roeg, Gene Wilder); Mike Medavoy, senior vice president of United Artists; director/writer John Milius (Dillinger, Dirty Harry, The Wind and The Lion); producer Julia Phillips (Taxi Driver, The Sting); director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind); agent Harry Ufland (Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Kaplan, Martin Brest, Robert DeNiro); director King Vidor (Our Daily Bread, The Crowd, Hallelujah, Duel in the Sun). Award-winning independent filmmaker Linda Feferman (Liz Swados: The Girl with the Incredible Feeling) is the interviewer who also portrays someone trying to break into feature film direction. What is particularly interesting about Mitchell Block’s work is his combined use of cinema-verite techniques and staged or scripted action. In No Lies this created the illusion of a documentary film. Block describes That’s My Advice to You as “a real documentary that is staged” as opposed to a “staged documentary that is real” (for example, Block’s 20-minute sequel to No Lies, shortly to be completed and hopefully a surprise addition to tonight’s program).

2/9/1978,9:45 PM,,The Films of John Ford,The Films of John Ford (22),They Were Expendable ,,"They Were Expendable, written for the screen by Service tragedian Frank “Spig” Wead, is one of Ford’s most complex and rewarding pictures. Long, slow-paced, fluid, evocative and understated, its cumulative impact is stunning. The battle sequences are the most pyrotechnic ever made, more like dreams of combat than actual firefighters, but the film’s best moments lie between the battles: the woman singing “My Country ‘Tis of Thee” in a night club as the squadron, just having heard about Pearl Harbor, files out in horror; the brief romance between John Wayne and Donna Reed, ended by a broken phone connection as final as death; Robert Montgomery’s farewell to his doomed squadron, “You older men . . . take care of the kids.” It’s the moment-to-moment texture of the film that makes it great. As James Agee wrote, “For what seems at least half of the length of They Were Expendable, all you have to watch is men getting on or off PT boats, and other men watching them do so. But this is made so beautiful and so real that I could not feel one foot of film was being wasted.”
I have only seen They Were Expendable once, and I’m looking forward with terrific anticipation to seeing it again. I suspect it may be one of Ford’s ultimate masterpieces, along with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Sun Shines Bright, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. We’ll see. That’s what this series is for. —Michael Goodwin

2/10/1978,7:00 PM,9:45 PM,,Two Films from South Africa! Boesman and Lena & Last Grave at Dimbaza,Boesman and Lena,,"Our American Premiere screening of Boesman and Lena in 1975, with the superb documentary Last Grave at Dimbaza, generated the following response from the San Francisco Chronicle’s critic, Judy Stone: “A stunning double-barreled dramatic and documentary indictment of South American racism . . . Boesman and Lena, Athol Fugard’s compelling portrayal of displaced Cape Coloreds, and Last Grave at Dimbaza, a powerful, low-key British documentary that was made secretly for the World Council of Churches and smuggled out of South Africa. While Fugard’s film brilliantly reaffirms the resilience of the human spirit even in the lowest depths of existence, the documentary is a chilling and shameful reminder of man’s inhumanity to man . . . Boesman and Lena, based on Fugard’s hit play, stars the white South African playwright as the Cape Colored Boesman, a cringing sycophant with white power figures and a brutal bully with Lena, his wife. He does a marvelously swarmy toadying dance when bulldozers crush out the miserable shacks of their shantytown. As the two trudge through the barren wastelands, looking for another place to pitch their pitiful sheet metal roof, Lena changes from a clinging shadow to an almost independent person. 
“It is a beautifully controlled transformation by Yvonne Bryceland. This inarticulate woman who doesn’t know who or what or where she is, trapped in the whirlpool of Boesman’s fury, begins to come alive when a nearly dead old Kaffir stumbles onto their beach shelter. She pours out the story of her suffering before the dazed black man, to the intense disgust of Boesman, who would treat Kaffir as the whites treat him. “The work is a tour-de-force. Fugard’s writing, almost as spare as Beckett’s, captures the most complex nuance of life under apartheid. The beautiful cinematography conveys the sweeping vistas of South Africa, eloquently contrasting it to the cramped lives of Boesman and Lena. Miss Bryceland is magnetic whether she is huddled under the black sky, swooping and cawing like a seagull, rolling into a mocking dance or mimicking Boesman’s acts of obeisance.”

2/10/1978,7:30 PM,,James Card Presents ,Rare Prints of Two Screen Masterworks by Bunuel and Pabst; Admission $2.00,L'age d'or,The Golden Age,"The Oxford Companion to Film states of this famous and hard-to-see surrealist classic: “Bunuel’s second film, perhaps his definitive work, in fact owes little to Salvador Dali. Two lovers (Gaston Modot and Lya Lys) declare war on a bourgeois society intent on thwarting the fulfillment of their desire. Charged with a surrealistic glee, L’age d’or shows a blind man being beaten, a dowager being slapped, a father punishing his son for a misdemeanor by shooting him down. In the final section of the film Bunuel doffs his hat to the Marquis de Sade, whose ideas on liberty the director holds dear. Shown at Studio 28, L'age d’or was officially banned after the cinema had been wrecked by a protesting mob of right-wing extremists.”
Bunuel himself reflects, “L’age d’or is the only film in my career conceived and created in a state of euphoria and enthusiasm, of vertigo for overthrowing things and deliberate seeking of scandal, dedicated to attacking the representatives of ‘order’ and ridiculing their ‘eternal’ principles.

Pandora’s Box is loosely adapted from two Franz Wedekind plays (Erdgeist and Die Buechse der Pandora) comprising the “Lulu” tragedy.

Under Pabst’s direction, the film is a masterpiece of atmosphere, camera movement, and editing; it is also one of the most sexually charged films ever made, largely due to the incendiary performance of American actress Louise Brooks, whose profound talents were discovered by Pabst, and whose genius has always been legendary in Europe.

2/11/1978,7:30 PM,,James Card Presents ,A Tribute to Gloria Swanson,,,"James Card has written: “In many ways movie stardom began with Gloria Swanson. The magic of personality requires a special skill to ‘register’ powerfully in the medium of shadow and illusion. The indefinable ingredients of this magic separate the mere performer from that unique creature, the film goddess; one who provokes admiration, imitation and often the most total and irrational devotion of a multitude of worshipers. This phenomenon began to take form when Gloria Swanson moved from the Essanay and the Sennett comedies to begin playing dramatic leads for the Triangle Company in 1918. From Triangle she went to Cecil B. DeMille who starred her as the very epitome of beautifully gowned yet strong-willed American womanhood. Gloria’s followers numbered more than the entire population of some countries at a time when ninety million Americans alone flocked to the movies every single week of the year.” 
This program, which James Card has presented at both the Telluride and Montreal Film Festivals, is his own compilation of excerpts highlighting Gloria Swanson’s screen career. Among the clips are sequences from His New Job (1915), Teddy at the Throttle (1916), The Danger Girl (1916), Shifting Sands (1918), Don’t Change Your Husband (1919), Male and Female (1919), The Affairs of Anatol (1921), Manhandled (1924), Stage Struck (1925), Sadie Thompson (1928), and Sunset Boulevard (1950).

2/11/1978,9:15 PM,,James Card Presents ,,Why Change Your Wife ,,"Six of Cecil B. DeMille’s films from 1918–1921 starred Gloria Swanson, playing a quintessentially modern American woman. These films dealt with modern marriage from a point of view that stressed sex and social manners more than the old-fashioned Puritan values of home and family. These films broke many screen taboos, and seen today, they are tremendously enjoyable as remarkably “adult” forerunners to the Lubitsch-style satires of the later ’20s, and as revealing documents of the early ’20s style, dress and manners. In Why Change Your Wife, Swanson plays a once fun-loving woman who, as the result of marriage, slips into a prim and dowdy personal phase. Her husband (Thomas Meighan) takes up with a vampish butterfly (Bebe Daniels) who wins him temporarily. A change of attitude on Swanson’s part results in an ultimate reconciliation, but not before some delightful comedy and a small dose of somewhat heavy-handed melodrama (a crucial, but unlikely “accident”). The costume and art direction are particularly outstanding, and Swanson and Daniels are sensational models, so that clothes freaks especially should not miss this seldom-revived DeMille classic.

2/12/1978,2:30 PM,,James Card Presents ,Two Rediscovered American Directors: John Collins & Monta Bell (Program One),Children of Eve,,"The first of three programs devoted to the almost unknown works by equally obscure directors whose names will soon become more familiar to students of the American Cinema, as the result of James Card’s one-man crusade for long-overdue recognition for John Collins and Monta Bell. According to Card: “Collins’ film debut has not yet been established. But the features he made for Edison that have thus far been restored are all extraordinary, beginning with the harsh, uncompromising Children of Eve (1915) and the extraordinary Cossack Whip (1916) parts of which look as though it could have been made by one of the Russian revolutionary directors.” Collins left Edison for Metro in California, where he made at least eight films in 1917–1918 before one of the most promising careers in American silent films was cut short by the deadly flu epidemic of 1918, which took the life of this 28 yr old filmmaker. Monta Bell (1891–1958) was assistant to Chaplin on The Pilgrim and A Woman of Paris before making his directorial debut in 1924 with Broadway After Dark, starring Norma Shearer and Adolphe Menjou. Erroneously labeled in some film histories as “a minor Lubitsch”—by virtue of the one or two polished, sophisticated comedies he directed (The King of Broadway in 1925 above all)—Monta Bell is really notable for his offbeat choice of material, an easy naturalistic style, and (in terms of the Griffithian dramatics of the time) an almost avant-garde approach to plot development and climax building. On the basis of The Snob (1924), Lady of the Night (1925), The Torrent (1926), Upstage (1926), Man, Woman and Sin (1927) and Downstairs (1932), James Card points out that Monta Bell deserves credit for a “unique contribution to American films: the anti-hero—that nasty, unadmirable, amoral, bastard that we were all so confident was born during the upheaving 1950s to come into his own throughout the following decade.”

2/12/1978,5:30 PM,9:00 PM,Vintage American Comedies,,Sullivan's Travels,,"There’s always an edge of bitterness to Preston Stueges’ comedies, and more than a touch of pain. Sullivan’s Travels, his funniest movie, is also one of his most poignant films in that it moves from comedy to near-tragedy and back again with a facility that is thoroughly remarkable. Halfway through, without a warning, the film turns deadly serious—and does so without losing credibility for an instant. That Sturges can bring the film back to comedy again is just one further indication of his genius. Veronica Lake is marvelous as a prototype hippie (circa 1935), and Joel McCrea is just as good playing Sullivan—a comedy director who wants to make Serious Movies. The slapstick is glorious, but to categorize Sullivan’s Travels as a mere comedy is to miss the point entirely. This is an amazing movie! —Micheal Goodwin

So This Is Paris, a rarely seen sex farce that the great Ernst Lubitsch filmed in a period that also saw his classics of Lady Windermere’s Fan and The Marriage Circle, is a case in point; two couples flirt with each other’s mates merely because they are bored with marriage.

2/13/1978,8:50 PM,,Yvette Biro Presents Contemporary Eastern European Cinema,,Landscape After Battle,Krajosbraz po bitwie,"In Landscape After Battle, Wajda returns once again to his first obsessional topic: where is the human measure to be found in a ruined, murdering world, where is the diamond amidst the ashes, if it exists at all. The film, as the title indicates, gives a rather frozen image of the first moments of victory; after the battle every moment is affected by death; killing, prison and senseless cruelty are not easy to forget. To survive means to carry the burden of an irremediable defeat, and therefore freedom is not a simple present, but a long road of self-creation. In this tragic landscape there is still place for the explosion and the light of love, even if doomed; it embodies beauty, happiness, the frail promise of human warmth. 
Wajda’s new star, Daniel Olbrychski—a young brother of Ashes and Diamonds’ Maciek-Cybulski—evokes wonderfully all the ambiguities of the hero: his bitterness and the sudden awakening desire for love and affirmation. Once again a symbolic figure of Polish destiny: the constant oscillation between resignation and action, despair and hope. A man facing the unavoidable challenge of historical decision. 
Landscape or self-portrait? A self-examination a la polonaise with the power, exuberance and passionate symbolism of great romantic poetry. —Y.B.

Available for years only in a sadly mutilated version, it now turns out to be not only L’Herbier’s finest film, but one of the cinema’s most successfully experimental films. Based on the Zola novel (but up-dated), it assembles a dream cast: Brigitte Helm as the evil Countess Sandorff who uses her bed the way others use Merrill Lynch; Alfred Abel (star of Metropolis) as the scheming speculator, and, in smaller roles, Yvette Guilbert and Antonin Artaud. Like Gance’s Napoleon, this is one of the crowning moments of the silent film.”

The result is this unusual “Upstairs/Downstairs” melodrama in which Gilbert plays an unscrupulous chauffeur in conflict with a virtuous butler (Paul Lukas). Too off-beat to go down at the box-office in 1932, Downstairs was forgotten and effectively “lost” until its recent rediscovery, which was celebrated at the 1977 New York Film Festival, where Downstairs was featured in Lincoln Center’s sub-Festival: “Saved!

2/15/1978,9:15 PM,,James Card Presents ,,The Diary of a Lost Girl,,"“The iridescent beauty of Louise Brooks had been exploited to dazzling effect by Pabst in Pandora’s Box. In The Diary of a Lost Girl, her role is only slightly less sensual. She plays a chemist’s daughter who is consigned to reform school when she gives birth to an illegitimate child. A major part of the film is devoted to the daily round at the formidable establishment. The matron in charge is clearly a sadist, and Tyvian is watched closely by a tall, bald-headed guardian, whose smiles are ingratiating and disturbing. Pabst’s taste for close-ups lends an almost tangible evil to their features. When, eventually, there is a revolt at the school, Tyvian and her friend Erika escape, and are soon enrolled in a brothel. Here Pabst’s style overflows with a mischievous joie de vivre; Tyvian quickly submits to the atmosphere of lechery and luxurious indulgence. Her dance with a client comprises one of the greatest erotic interludes on film. But the death of her father means that she is a wealthy young woman, and once more she returns to the drugstore where she grew up (although the original, censored version ended with her becoming Madame at the brothel). Even at the end, Pabst includes an unforgivable sequence, as the funeral of a count who had commited suicide on Tyvian’s account takes place in the local cemetery. All in all, the film affords a penetrating and often haunting picture of German bourgeois society in the late twenties, when authoritarianism and license were alarmingly close neighbors.” —Peter Cowie, “Sixty Years of Cinema.”

2/15/1978,7:30 PM,,,Bay Area Premiere! Admission $2.50,A Touch of Zen ,,"A surprise hit at the 1975 Cannes and London Film Festivals, as well as Los Angeles’ Filmex in 1976, this kung-fu epic gained this typical critical reaction from Alexander Walker of London’s Evening Standard: 
“It is unlike any other kung-fu film I have ever seen. It raises the generally debased genre, referred to with a certain justice as ‘chop socky’ in Variety, to the level of art. . . . it is simply breath-taking to see what its director, a Peking-born actor-artist-producer-director-writer called King Hu, has done. The kung-fu fights still predominate. But this time it is the difference between a street brawl and a royal ballet. Filmed on Formosa, not in Hongkong, the movie is closer in looks and spirit to the great Japanese epics like Rashomon. It folds its violent story into a landscape of ultra-poetic refinement where the camera takes as much aesthetic pleasure in the quiver of a birch branch as King Hu does in bringing the Zen philosophy of ‘mind over matter’ to bear on the physical encounters between a group of Buddhist priests and the Ming Dynasty’s secret police. There are night scenes of unbelievably thrilling combat, lit by the moon or torches, clanging with the sound of blades and whistling with hailstorms of steel spears—you never get the chance to see from which direction death comes, so that it appears as a bizarre continuum of the action, rather than the end result. I remember with particular relish the shots of the combatants leaping like kangaroos through the bamboo glades; the chief priest catching a sweeping sword-blade contemptuously between finger and thumb; and the final encounter on a dry plain where the holy man is stabbed by the magnificently ferocious and tenacious commandant of the secret police—and instead of blood, he bleed gold! The film lasts three hours, but feels like only one.”

Based on a real event at the end of the century, the comedy describes the romantic dreams and weaknesses of the intelligentsia. For Wajda a kind of synthesis, to put in one unique metaphor all the ideas and emotions, judgement and love, hate and pride concerning the nation he belongs to, a settling of accounts with this blessed-damned tradition he has wrestled with throughout his career. Respecting faithfully the poetry of the play, Wajda miraculously succeeded in creating an expressive cinematic universe in the form of an endless, magnetic dance where characters, ideas, sets, colors, music and legends equally play the roles of an historical dream. —Y.B.

2/16/1978,9:30 PM,,The Films of John Ford ,The Films of John Ford (23),My Darling Clementine,,"It was time for Ford to make another Western. There had only been two in 20 years: Three Bad Men (a great one) in 1926, and Stagecoach (another great one) in 1939. Then too, as Purveyor of American Mysteries, it was only a matter of time until he got around to the gunfight at the OK Corral. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Tombstone, Arizona—they had been waiting for him for 65 years.
The gunfight itself (in which, by extension, law, order and civilization come to the West) seems to have interested Ford less than the texture of daily life: Wyatt’s haircut, Doc’s drinking, the comic adventures of a drunken Shakespearean actor, transposed as if in a nightmare to this frontier town on the edge of the world. Ford would return to the law and order theme in Liberty Valance (where he would treat it far more seriously and ambiguously); here we have, instead, some of the most glorious iconography in Ford’s entire oevre, including many scenes much beloved by Fordian critics, like the one where Henry Fonda rocks in his chair on the front porch of the sheriff’s office, and the one where he whirls Clementine into a dance in a half-finished church, thereby taking his place in society and coming of age at last. —Micheal Goodwin

With Lubitsch a new art carried on the subtleties of Marivaux and the comedy of manners made its debut on the screen.’ Edmund Wilson, surely no movie fan, rhapsodized about it at the time, pointing out even its physical beauty: ‘He has clothed it in such beautiful photography and directed it with so much resourcefulness that he has turned out a very attractive film.’” —Herman G.

(Traore states that his purpose is “to show how religion is used to exploit these people.”) And it is psychologically astute in its observation of ingrained colonial structures. A recent showing in London prompted one British critic to note of N’jangaan: “Another contemporary story, told in a strong, unsentimental, almost brutal manner. A small boy is sent to a school in a distant village. His father, a devout Muslim, entrusts him to the far from tender mercies and teachings of an equally fanatical head of a religious school. The brutality of his existence (the pupils are fed only from the money they raise by begging) eventually leads the boy to run away, despite the fact that his intelligence and beautiful voice have made him the star pupil. The tragic ending is a savage comment on the inflexibility and severity of the ‘system’ depicted.”

But if his style may be sophisticated, he still gives a feeling of the African experience in this tale of a young boy and girl trying to emigrate to what they think is a better life, or at least more money, in France. It has a picaresque quality as the young man gets involved in stealing as well as a series of incidents that reflect on the old and new ways of the country. In fact, he finally gives up his chance to leave due to an almost atavistic need to find a fetish of his before he can go. But the girl gets away. Their scenes of idyllic love, the reflections of advanced students shunning and deriding old ways instead of helping to change them and former colonists in visits or still working there and their still haughty attitudes, are also worked into this sharply-made, lensed and played little drama.”

2/19/1978,4:30 PM,7:45 PM,Vintage American Comedies ,,Nothing Sacred ,,"We added Nothing Sacred to the AFI’s package of new 35mm prints of Vintage American Comedies, not because we have obtained a new 35mm print of this screwball comedy classic which is only seen today in horrible 16mm color dupes—but because we have been able to borrow from the Selznick Vaults (courtesy of Daniel Mayer Selnick) a unique 35mm original Technicolor Print! Recently the New Yorker noted of a Nothing Scared revival: “What are generally sentimentalized as ‘the little people’ are the satiric targets of this famous thirties comedy. According to Ben Hecht, who wrote the script, they are boobs and lascivious slobs. They drip crocodile tears over a girl they think is dying of radium poisoning, and enjoy every minute of it. The audience may begin to wonder what makes the reporter hero, Fredric March, and the girl, Carole Lombard—who was by that time ‘the screwball girl’ and the ‘Duse of daffy comedy’—any better than anyone else. The answer can only be that they, like the author, hate phoniness. William Wellman’s direction is more sluggishly paced than usual, but the film has many classic sequences: March’s leg being bitten by a small boy; Lombard passing out while showgirls impersonating the heroines of history parade in her honor; and a great slugging match between March and Lombard. With Walter Connolly as the dyspeptic big city editor, Charles Winninger as the alcoholic small-town doctor, Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom, in his acting debut, and Frank Fay. (The film spawned a Broadway musical, ‘Hazel Flagg,’ as well as a movie with Jerry Lewis in the Lombard role.)

2/19/1978,5:55 PM,9:10 PM,Vintage American Comedies ,,Miss Tatlock's Millions,,"Schuyler Tatlock, banished by his wealthy family to a Polynesian island because of the Jerry Lewis-level idiocy with which he is afflicted, is called home to take part in the reading of a will. Unfortunately, Schuyler is dead—victim of his life-long fascination with matches. His desperate custodian (Barry Fitzgerald) then hires a Hollywood stunt man (John Lund) to pose as the potential heir, and the hoax nearly works because Lund’s lunacy is so convincing (with the Tatlocks watching in horror, he sings “I Don’t Want To Set the World on Fire,” then sets the living room curtains ablaze; later, Uncle Miles Tatlock [Monty Woolley in a reprise of Sheridan Whiteside], afraid that his nephew will inherit the family fortune, makes phonily gregarious gestures to the lad, and Lund spits fruit seeds into his beard). The going really gets tough when Lund has to resist the incestuous tinglies he gets when his ‘sister’ (Wanda Hendrix) wears a flimsy negligee to teach him the alphabet (which she accomplishes by lightly scratching each letter on his bare back with her fingernails). Thanks to its bright screenplay and the zeal with which it is performed, Miss Tatlock’s Millions is one of Hollywood’s funniest black comedies—filmed about 15 years before they became fashionable in this country.

2/20/1978,5:30 PM,,The Films of Ernst Lubitsch ,,Madame Dubarry ,,"“A milestone in the artistic development of the screen” is a way Lubitsch biographer Herman G. Weinberg characterizes this film. It was the first that would bring its director international fame, the first to be shown in this country (under the title Passion) and also the first to make ‘big money.’ It ran for three months in the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin as the initial program in this newly built largest German movie house. It opened in New York at the Capitol Theater, on Broadway and 50th Streets, then the largest movie house in the world. Madame Dubarry was the first historical film that tried to humanize history. While it took great liberty with the facts (particularly in the sequence following Louis XV’s death) it must be considered a highly successful attempt to open up new dimensions for the cinema. When Madame Dubarry was released here, none of the actors was named in the credits, with the exception of Pola Negri, and Lubitsch was labelled not a German, but simply a “European” director.

2/20/1978,7:30 PM,,The Films of Ernst Lubitsch ,,Monte Carlo ,,"“A high-spirited exercise in cinema panache. The last vestiges of the operetta stage had now disappeared and Lubitsch had achieved absolute fluidity of camera movement as in his best silent films, while sound has now been deftly integrated with the image.” —Herman G. Weinberg, “The Lubitsch Touch” 
Monte Carlo is most famous for its delirious “Beyond the Blue Horizon” sequence, a sound-and-image symphony of speeding train wheels, whizzing tracks, and flying landscapes. The story has Jeanette MacDonald as a countess who runs off to the casinos of Monte Carlo in order to evade matrimony with a foppish prince. There a triangle develops when British gentleman Jack Buchanan poses as her hairdresser in order to gain entrance to her boudoir (the film develops a hair fetish that would make Luis Bunuel envious), and it all winds up with life imitating art as the plot resolution parallels a performance of the opera Monsieur Beaucaire. Special mention should be made of the presence of Claude Allister, who is undoubtedly one of the cinema’s greatest walking sight-gags as the asthmatic and prunefaced Prince Otto. 
Directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Adapted from the play, The Blue Coat, by Hans Muller, and episode from Monsieur Beaucaire, by Booth Tarkington and Evelyn Sutherland. Screenplay by Ernest Vajda.

2/21/1978,7:30 PM,,,New Films by Jon Jost; Jon Jost in Person ,Angel City,,"The 1977 Edinburgh Film Festival presented a retrospective of American independent filmmaker Jon Jost’s work which will be presented at the Archive this month. Jost’s situation is similar to that of Robert Kramer in that his films have received more critical attention in Europe than in the United States; in Jost’s case, notably from Jean-Luc Godard, who has said, “Jon Jost is not a traitor to the movies, unlike almost all American directors. He makes them move.”
A sometime structuralist documentary masquerading as self-destructing farcical detective “story,” Angel City is set in Los Angeles, specifically its metaphorical heart: Hollywood, where we are escorted by a private eye, Frank Goya who, investigating the mysterious death of falling starlet Gloria Franklin, unravels the essential capitalist decay at the core of Sunset Boulevard. Playfully incorporating a numerological system, Angel City inexorably and comically leads us to an ending from which we may begin.

2/21/1978,9:30 PM,,Yvette Biro Presents Contemporary Eastern European Cinema ,,WR—Mysteries of The Organism,,"Eros and Politics—rarely linked up, in a hilarious comedy, a playful application of Wilhelm Reich’s sexual revolutionary ideas. Makavejev’s malicious criticism turns against the oppressive ideologies of both Eastern and Western systems and in his delightful, frivolous way strives for liberation. Raw, wild and grotesque, making fun of the most saintly social, sexual and political taboos, WR remains a unique treatise, in the unusual form of a surrealistic collage, associating with lighthanded didacticism statements, facts, symbols and documents. 
“A prophet of joy rather than doom, he points out the masturbatory basis of this era of the concentration camp and the closed mind. Where Godard constipates, Makavejev induced a blessed liberation in the bowels . . .” —Basil Wright
“I believe there is a basic libido in movies, some very erotic energy created by visual patterns, some life energy,” says Makavejev. It is just this life energy that nourishes Makavejev’s provocative images, insolent jokes, finally a sweet-cheerful invitation to the dance of liberty.” —Y.B.

2/22/1978,7:00 PM,9:30 PM,The Films of Yasujiro Ozu & The Family in Japanese Cinema,,Tokyo Story ,,"Tokyo Story is about the gap between generations in a typical Japanese family. It tells a simple, sad story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their two married children, only to find themselves politely ushered off to a hot springs resort. Ozu’s technique, as spare and concentrated as a Haiku master’s verse, transforms the very banalities of the subject into moments of intimacy and beauty seldom captured on film. As always, the themes go beyond the obvious and are conveyed so gently, so subtly that only afterwards are many apparent—like the idea, so discreetly implied by Ozu’s depiction of the plight of the bereft widowed daughter-in-law, that it is best to forget dead loved ones and go on living. Verbalizing Ozu’s themes, like trying to synopsize his plots, can be self-defeating. Like the mood of high summer that pervades Tokyo Story, his films register their effects surreptitiously, and initially at a half-conscious level of feeling. They can be seen many times, and should be. Of all his masterwork, Tokyo Story is perhaps most easily accessible to western audiences.

2/23/1978,4:00 PM,,Yvette Biro Presents Contemporary Eastern European Cinema,Admission Free ,Adoption,,"“Since my first film, The Girl, I attempt in a very deliberate and stubborn way to portray women capable of making independent decisions… I did it when ‘feminism’ was not yet fashionable… In the center of all my films there is a woman who is forced to make a decision, fully independent… Everywhere the ideal woman is the tender, passive, adaptive person who is submissive. Since the family is the basic form of life, every young girl between 20 and 30 has the ambition to find a husband… In Adoption, Kata, the heroine, is looking for another solution: instead of forcing the man who already has a family to support her, she adopts a child.”
The statement of Marta Meszaros describes very precisely the goals of her film. She really succeeded in creating strong, determined and durable female personalities, without risk to their humanity. She depicted the sobriety of solitude. Adoption is an attractive, simple story, avoiding romantic and sentimental elements: even at the end, it doesn’t give us any assurance of eventual happiness. However, through a developing relationship of love and understanding, a kind of self-responsibility defines itself. Certainly, Adoption is very much a woman’s film—this quality provides an introspective style with precise observations, and an astonishingly dry, lyrical mood. Adoption won the Grand Prize of the 1975 Berlin Festival.

It is presented in an intermixed series of obviously manipulated dramatic scenes juxtaposed against flat ‘documentary slices’ of ‘reality,’ all linked by a series of Country and Western songs. Cinematically, Last Chants uses a variety of graphic reconstructions and abstract elements in order to probe expressively and expose the interior breakdown of its main character.” —Jon Jost.

2/23/1978,9:30 PM,,The Films of John Ford ,The Films of John Ford (24),The Fugitive,,"The Fugitive is one of John Ford’s least popular films; it was also, paradoxically, one of his personal favorites. Starring Henry Fonda as a Catholic priest on the run in a South American police state, it was (in the opinion of Andrew Sarris) an attempt to “recapture the mystical, expressionist aura of The Informer.” If it seems overly arty (in a way that neither The Informer nor The Long Voyage Home does), it remains one of Ford’s most serious and ambitious films, and therefore worthy of another look. Sarris finds it fatally flawed. So did James Agee, but at least he was decently ambiguous: “I think The Fugitive is a bad work of art”, he wrote, “tacky, unreal, and pretentious. Yet I… have seldom seen… such grandeur and sobriety of ambition, such continuous intensity of treatment or such frequent achievement of what was obviously worked for, however misguided or distasteful I think it.” Whew!
Finally, though, we’re showing The Fugitive simply because Ford’s Catholicism is of crucial importance to a full appraisal of his life’s work. Here we find many secrets revealed that will explicate other, more successful films. As you can see, we’re ambiguous too. —Michael Goodwin

2/24/1978,6:00 PM,,The Films of Ernst Lubitsch ,,Die Puppe,,"In his book The Lubitsch Touch, Herman G. Weinberg writes of Die Puppe: “Before the year’s end, Die Puppe (The Doll) came out, a fantasy inspired by themes from E.T.A. Hoffman, from which Offenbach had also drawn for his “Tale of Hoffman.” Set principally in a doll-maker’s boutique (a mechanical doll is brought to life and marries the doll-maker’s apprentice), utilizing all manner of camera tricks including the split screen, superimposition, high-speed photography, multiple exposures (there is one shot of twelve images of mouths in a single frame), the film was full of droll effects. It is inventive even before the film proper starts by showing Lubitsch touch’ at work, side by side with the old slapstick of his apprentice days. Amusing, also, were the anticlerical barbs directed at a group of hedonistic monks in a monastery who somehow become involved in the zany proceedings.”
Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, Screenplay by Hans Kraly and Lubitsch. With Ossi Oswalda, Herman Thimig, Victor Janson. (1919, 48 mins, German intertitles with live English translation) 
Kohlhiesel’s Daughter is a broad village comedy, and, as such, quite different from Lubitsch’s previous output, proving that he was a master in all genres. In the film, little of Lubitsch’s previously noted finesse can be found—in true slapstick fashion people throw objects at each other, pour soup over one another, gorge themselves with dumplings, etc.—but the comic effects never seem strained: The success of the world premiere at the newly built Ufa Palast am Zoo remained with this relaxing comedy. It established Henny Porten in the dual role of the two sisters as a favorite of the German public. For Jannings, the part of the simple, boorish Peter was also quite a change from the debonair Louis XV he had portrayed in Madame Dubarry a few months earlier, and left no doubt about his great histrionic talent which he displayed to even greater advantage later on. Kohlhiesel’s Daughter had two remakes in Germany with soundtrack: 1930 again with Henny Porten and in 1943. None was as successful as the original. Henny Porten produced the 1930 version herself.

The film had been considered lost until having recently appeared in the collection of The American Association of Physics Teachers by whose permission it is being shown tonight. 
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, another early Fleischer scientific subject, surfaces recently and is seen in its original tinted and toned, color version. The film combines animation, stock footage and Willis O’Brien’s dinosaur sequence from his Ghost of Slumber Mountain.
Koko’s Earth Control, one of the popular Out of the Inkwell cartoons, shows that Max Flesischer’s interest in scientific subjects was not always confined to a serious presentation as in the former features. 
Max Fleischer, the veteran cartoon producer best known for Popeye the Sailor and Betty Boop cartoons, began in 1910 as a staff artist on the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper. His interest in science eventually led him to an associate editorship of the Popular Science Monthly, Max began experimenting with the animated cartoon around 1914 and found in the medium a perfect merger of his interests in art and mechanics.
Fleischer’s first cartoon featuring a clown to be named “Koko” was produced with his brothers, Dave and Joe. The Fleischers’ production of Einstein’s Theory in 1923 was a remarkable achievement on several counts. It may have been that first feature-length animated cartoon and at the time it was claimed that only seven men in the world even understood the theory. Max went them one better and with his help that knowledge became considerably less exclusive. It is reported that long lines of people crowded the sidewalks in bitter cold Chicago weather to see the film, a veritable Star Wars of its day. 
Not much is known about the sponsors of the actual production of the feature. Max had said that Einstein himself wrote to the producers of the film declaring it “an excellent attempt at illuminating an abstract subject.”
Darwin’s Theory was produced in 1924 in connection with the New York Museum of Natural History. Made during the famous Scopes Trial, Max defended the film as not intending to preach the authenticity of the theory but merely to illustrate it.

2/25/1978,2:00 PM,,,Rare Max Fleischer Cartoons Featuring Einstein's Theory of Relativity; Admission $1.00,Darwin's Theory of Evolution,,"This special screening of Max Flesicher’s Einstein’s Theory of Relativity might well be the first public viewing in more than 40 years. The film had been considered lost until having recently appeared in the collection of The American Association of Physics Teachers by whose permission it is being shown tonight. 
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, another early Fleischer scientific subject, surfaces recently and is seen in its original tinted and toned, color version. The film combines animation, stock footage and Willis O’Brien’s dinosaur sequence from his Ghost of Slumber Mountain.
Koko’s Earth Control, one of the popular Out of the Inkwell cartoons, shows that Max Flesischer’s interest in scientific subjects was not always confined to a serious presentation as in the former features. 
Max Fleischer, the veteran cartoon producer best known for Popeye the Sailor and Betty Boop cartoons, began in 1910 as a staff artist on the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper. His interest in science eventually led him to an associate editorship of the Popular Science Monthly, Max began experimenting with the animated cartoon around 1914 and found in the medium a perfect merger of his interests in art and mechanics.
Fleischer’s first cartoon featuring a clown to be named “Koko” was produced with his brothers, Dave and Joe. The Fleischers’ production of Einstein’s Theory in 1923 was a remarkable achievement on several counts. It may have been that first feature-length animated cartoon and at the time it was claimed that only seven men in the world even understood the theory. Max went them one better and with his help that knowledge became considerably less exclusive. It is reported that long lines of people crowded the sidewalks in bitter cold Chicago weather to see the film, a veritable Star Wars of its day. 
Not much is known about the sponsors of the actual production of the feature. Max had said that Einstein himself wrote to the producers of the film declaring it “an excellent attempt at illuminating an abstract subject.”
Darwin’s Theory was produced in 1924 in connection with the New York Museum of Natural History. Made during the famous Scopes Trial, Max defended the film as not intending to preach the authenticity of the theory but merely to illustrate it.
Science buffs, film fans and Fleischer devotees consider yourselves witness to an historic event tonight. And please—read the titles to yourselves.

2/25/1978,7:00 PM,10:45 PM,,Two Film by Carlos Saura,Garden of Delights,,"The Spanish CInema—long frozen under Franco—has come to life with a vengeance, and a tremendous creative outpouring that marks Spain as the most exciting film-producing country in Europe today. The central figure in the New Spanish Cinema is undoubtedly Carlos Saura, who was able—thanks to oblique and allegorical story-telling—to make powerful films reflecting the contradictions in Spanish society even before the Dictator’s death. Los golfos (1959) and The Hunt (1965) were powerful statements on social violence in Spain. Garden of Delights (1970) is perhaps the first masterpiece in the New Spanish Cinema: it was followed in Saura’s output by Ana and the Wolves (1972), Cousin Angelica (1973), and Cria (1975). At its American Premiere showing at the New York Film Festival, Richard Roud noted: “Like The Hunt, Carlos Saura’s latest film is an extended metaphor. A greedy family goes to incredible lengths to shock their son out of his amnesia. They want the number of his Swiss bank account. Their methods include re-enactments of incidents from his whole life, and these psychodramas build up a picture not only of the man but of Spain itself—which makes the film more than just a brilliant black comedy.”

2/25/1978,8:50 PM,,,Two Film by Carlos Saura,Cousin Angelica,,"Carlos Saura’s Cousin Angelica is, as its director noted, “the first film ever made in Spain about the Civil War from the standpoint of those who lost it.” Saura is the wittiest and most intricate of modern-day Spanish film-makers; his films take the form of complex, playful, memory-mazes, filled with allusion and allegory. Cousin Angelica tells of a middle-aged man who returns to a Castilian town where he relives his past: the outbreak of the Civil War, the death of his mother, his pubescent love affair with his beautiful cousin. Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez’ drolly lugubrious performance acts as a perfect comic counterweight to the story’s sweetly painful nostalgia and Saura’s wildly surrealist improvisations—the overall effect is as if Buster Keaton had wandered into a novel by Proust, with annotations by Andre Breton.

2/26/1978,4:30 PM,8:00 PM,,Albert Johnson Presents Two Rediscovered MGM Musicals; Please Note: Albert Johnson will introduce the 6:05 and 8:00 showings,Give a Girl a Break,,"After the successful period of co-direction with Gene Kelly (On the Town, Singin’ in the Rain), Stanley Donen was given a chance to do a solo job on a low-budget musical. Under the production unit supervised by Jack Cummings, Donen turned out a sprightly song-and-dance film that captured critics’ attention and justified their praise of Marge and Gower Champion as an incipient reincarnation of Astaire and Rogers, and gave an opportunity for Debbie Reynolds to try out her lyrical impulses with a young newcomer from Broadway: Bob Fosse. The premise of it all was the usual three-girls-on-Broadway formula, and surprisingly, everything works. Helen Wood, a semi-acrobatic ballerina, was plucked out of the MGM showgirl regiment to play one of the three hopefuls, and she is brilliant. Unfortunately, she and just about everyone else (except Donen) were ignored by the studio afterward, but with a tuneful Gershwin-Lane score, this little exercise remains a joyful rediscovery from the recent past. —A.J.

As a vehicle for Jane Powell, the glamorous wren of MGM, one finds her to be exceptionally perky and lyrical while convincing most spectators that she must have been the original American girl-next-door. The involvement of Miss Powell with a cocksure young millionaire (Farley Granger) who happens to upset the denizens of Duck Creek, somewhere in movie-suburbia, is a slight framework for some extraordinary songs and dances. Fortunately, these routines are performed by Ann Miller, the leggy tapster, absolutely beside herself in a field of jazz instruments (staged by Busby Berkeley); and Bobby Van, that lost young genius, leaps out of temporary obscurity to prove that he was, way back then, a likely successor to Gene Kelly. For nostalgia buffs, the late Nat Cole contributes a guest song, and suddenly, there is Fay Wray, recovered from the grips of Kong, and quite at home in the Technicolored environment of tra-la-las. —A.J.

Lubitsch had played a small part in the original stage production, and for his own screen version gave himself the major role of Yegzar the Hunchback!

2/27/1978,7:30 PM,,The Films of Ernst Lubitsch,Two Noel Coward Adaptations,Design for Living,,"“Design for Living is one of the great comedies of the thirties—sophisticated, beautifully crafter, excellently played, distinguished by Ben Hecht’s literate, cynical dialogue out of the play by Noel Coward. The film is involved with the ups and downs of an unconventional menage à trois: a struggling playwright (Fredric March), an undiscovered painter (Gary Cooper), and a commercial artist (Miriam Hopkins) who loves them both and moves between them with casual promiscuity. The direction is sophisticated and inspired, evoking bohemian, expatriate Paris with a few clever touches, suggesting seduction with his characters in evening clothes, and using Edward Everett Horton as the perfect foil and fool who eventually leads Hopkins into a marriage that will soon dissolve in boredom and infidelity.” —Stephen Zito, AFI.

2/27/1978,9:15 PM,,,Two Noel Coward Adaptations,Private Lives,,"“However unfaithful to Noel Coward this adaptation may be, Private Lives embodies at least the spirit of the playwright and his time. As Amanda and Elyot, divorcees who meet again on the night of their second marriages and realize they have always been in love, Norma Shearer and Robert Montgomery are superb. Cool, desperate to be uncommitted but frequently slipping, they convince completely, especially in the famous balcony scene where, first with bitterness then returning passion, they review their marriage and the meaninglessness of their lives since its ending. Coward’s malicious wit comes out in all their exchanges, however, and is allowed free rein in the second half of the film, where the runaway lovers are tracked down in their Swiss chalet by their legal spouses (Frances Lederer and Una Merkel) who are then demolished at a hilarious breakfast confrontation. Franklin is deft in his handling of this essentially four-cornered conversational comedy, beyond criticism in his direction of dialogue. For polish, few comedies of the Thirties can equal this early alliance of cinema and stage” —John Baxter. Directed by Sidney Franklin. Also with: Reginald Denny, Jean Hersholt.

2/28/1978,7:00 PM,9:30 PM,,New French Cinema; A West Coast Premiere!; Jean-Louis Comolli in Person!,La Cecilia,,"“Of the new films screened at the Edinburgh Festival this summer, the one that impressed me most strongly. . . was Jean-Louis Comolli’s La Cecilia. It is necessary to state this thus baldly, because the film attracted relatively little critical attention and has not yet found a distributor in this country: it would be tragic were it allowed to disappear. Although set in the nineteenth century, it raises the most central and crucial contemporary issues and treats them in a highly intelligent and complex way. Based on fact, it described the efforts of a group of Italian anarchists (eleven men and one woman) to found a colony (the ‘La Cecilia’ of the title) in Brazil —a commune without fences, either literal or metaphorical. The film, through its unambiguous sympathy for the enterprise, challenges all the major ideological assumptions of establish society—property, monogamy, the family—while acknowledging with great honesty the difficulties involved in an attempt to break cleanly with an ideology that is not merely something ‘out there’ but is structured deeply within each individual.”  —Robin Wood.
